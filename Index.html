        <h2>What You'll Discover</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Introduction to Biology</h3>
                <p>You will dive into the world of Biology, understand its branches, and its importance in our daily life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>The Cell: The Basic Unit of Life</h3>
                <p>Before diving into organs and systems, it's crucial to understand the fundamental building block of all living things: **the cell**. This section could cover the different types of cells (prokaryotic and eukaryotic), their organelles, and the basic processes they carry out, like metabolism and reproduction. Understanding the cell is the starting point for all biological study.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Organs</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying organs is fundamental to understanding how living organisms function and maintain health. Organs are the specialized "tools" of the body, and learning about them helps us understand how they work together to perform vital tasks like circulation (heart and blood vessels), digestion (stomach, liver, and intestines), and breathing (lungs). Understanding these systems is key to comprehending the body as a whole.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Systems</h3>
                <p>We should understand how our organs and tissues work together to keep us alive and healthy. It's essential for medical science, diagnosing and treating diseases, and making informed choices about our own health.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Classification of Living Things</h3>
                <p>Classification is essential because it provides a structured system for organizing the immense diversity of life on Earth. This system, known as **taxonomy**, helps us understand the evolutionary relationships between different organisms, revealing how species have evolved over time from common ancestors. It also helps scientists identify and name new species, predict characteristics, and better understand complex ecosystems for conservation efforts.</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Genetics and Heredity</h3>
                <p>A major pillar of modern biology is **genetics**. This section could explain how DNA carries the instructions for life, how traits are passed down from one generation to the next, and the incredible impact of genetics on everything from medicine to agriculture. You could discuss concepts like genes, chromosomes, and the double helix structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Ecology and Interdependence</h3>
                <p>A dedicated section on &nbsp;ecology &nbsp;would explore the relationships between organisms and their environments. Key concepts to include would be food webs, biodiversity, and how human activity impacts the planet. This would tie into the conservation efforts you already mentioned and highlight the importance of protecting our world.</p>
