<p><b>Biology</b> is the scientific study of life. It helps us understand the living world and ourselves.</p>
<p><b>Here are some key reasons why it's so important:</b></p>
​<h3>Advancing Health and Medicine</h3>
<p>Biology is fundamental to medicine. It has led to major breakthroughs like:</p>
<br>
<p><b>- Vaccines and antibiotics:</b> These have saved countless lives by helping us fight diseases.</p>
<br>
<p><b>- Genetic research:</b> This is paving the way for personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>- Understanding diseases:</b> Biologists study what causes illnesses, from viruses and bacteria to genetic disorders, which is the first step in finding cures.</p>
​<h3>Protecting Our Environment</h3>
<p>By studying biology, we learn about ecosystems and how all living things interact with each other and their environment.</p>
<br>
<p><b>- Conservation:</b> It helps us protect endangered species and preserve biodiversity.</p>
<br>
<p><b>- Climate change:</b> Biology informs us about how climate change affects ecosystems and helps us develop strategies to mitigate its impact.</p>
​<h3>Ensuring Food Security</h3>
<p>Biology is crucial for agriculture. Researchers use their knowledge of plant biology to develop crops that are more resilient to pests, diseases, and changing climates, helping to ensure a stable food supply for the world's population.</p>

 <br>

<u><b>

1.Nutrition <br></u>
</b>

It’s a process by which living things obtain food from the environment.
All living things take in food from which they obtain materials for energy 
production, body growth, and Repair. 
Green plants make their own food while the rest obtain already made food from the 
environment.<br>
<br>

<br>
<u><b>

2. Respiration<br></u>
</b>


This is This is the breakdown of food to release energy in the body using oxygen obtained the breakdown of food to release energy in the body using oxygen obtained 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<u><b>

3. Excretion<br></u>
</b>


Is the process by which waste products are removed from the body e.g. urea in 
urine, carbon dioxide, etc.
<br><br>
<br>

<u><b>

4. Reproduction<br></u>
</b>


This is the ability of an organism to give rise to new organisms similar to the 
parent.<br>
<br>

<br>
<u><b>

5. Movement<br></u>
</b>


This is the ability of an organism to transfer its body from one place to another. 
They move in search for food, water, shelter, mates, and run away from predators.
<br><br>
<br>

<u><b>

6. Growth <br></u>
</b>


Growth is a permanent increase in size of an organism. It is followed by 
development. 
<br><br>
<br>

<u><b>

7. Irritability / sensitivity<br></u></b>



It ability of an organism to respond to changes in its environment

<br><b>

13.Objective lens:<br></b>


 Magnifies the specimen under study. They are normally two or three. Low 
power (shortest), medium power and high power (longest).
Care of a microscope
The microscope is very delicate, expensive instrument which is very useful in the 
study of biology. Thus it should be handled carefully doing the <b>
following;</b>
<br>

<br>
It should be carried with both hands.
<br><br>

Should never be dropped.
<br><br>

Always kept in an upright position
<br><br>

Only wipe the lens with soft lens tissue.
<br><br>

It should always be kept in its special designed box.

<p>
  
  Bunsen burner;  a gas burner used in laboratories; has an air valve to regulate the mixture of gas and air
  Heat<br>

By Defn: Heat is the condition of being hot
Source of heat
Heat can be obtained in two ways<br>

i. Natural source of heat<br>

ii. Artificial source of heat
Natural source of heat<br>

By Defn: Natural source of heat is the kind of 
heat in which cannot made by human. <br>
For 
example heat from the sun
Artificial source of heat<br>

By Defn: Artificial source of heat is the kind of 
heat in which made by human.<br>
 For example 
heat from the spirit lamp, Kerosene stove, 
Bunsen burner and gas stove<br>

Nb:<br>

i. Heat is the energy<br>

ii. All chemical processes (reaction) whether 
combination or decomposition involves 
heat energy<br>

Heat sources in the laboratory<br>

In the laboratories is the different source of 
heat which can be used in the chemistry 
laboratory for various purposes. <br>
For example<br>

i. spirit lamp<br>

ii. Kerosene stove<br>

iii. Bunsen burner<br>

iv.gas stove<br>

<b>
Flame</b>
  
  <iframe width="350" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZmRVbIeNo8"allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

By Defn: flame is a zone of burning gases 
that produces heat and light. <br>
It is the visible 
glowing part of a fire
<b>
<br>
Diagram:</b><br>
<img src="fire1.jpg" height="200px" width="250px">

<b>
 <br>

Nb:</b><br>


i. Flame formed due to burning of fuel<br>

ii. The colour and temperature of flame 
depend on the type of fuel burning and 
the source of the flame<br>

iii. In order flame to happens the component 
of fire triangle should be completed which 
is fuel, oxygen and heat
<b>
<br>
Types of flame</b><br>


They are two main types of flame includes<br>

i. Luminous flame<br>

ii. Non luminous flame
Luminous flame<br>

By Defn: Luminous flame is the flame with 
yellow colour, produces soot and does not 
give more heat. It produced when the 
oxygen supply is usually not enough to 
complete burn up the fuel<br>
 <b>
<br>

Diagram:</b>
<br>
<img src="fire2.jpg" height="200px" width="250px">
<br>

Parts of Luminous Flame
It consists four parts includes<br>

i. Thin outer zone<br>

ii. Luminous and yellow zone<br>

iii. Zone of unburnt gas<br>

iv.Blue or green zone<br>

<b>
Why produce soot?<br></b>


It produces soot because oxygen supplied is 
not enough to complete burn up the fuel<br>

<b><br>

Why produce less heat?</b><br>


It produces less heat because oxygen 
supplied is not enough to complete burn up 
the fuel<br>

Non luminous flame<br>

</b>
By Defn:</b>
 Non Luminous flame is the flame <br>

with blue colour does not produce soot and  give more heat.It's produced when oxygen supply is enough to completely burn the fuel<br></b><br>

Parts of Bunsen burner</h3></b>

<b><br>

i. Barrel </b>
– round pipe whereby oxygen and 
gas burn at its top<br>

<b>
ii. Air hole</b>
 – it allow air (oxygen) to support 
burning of gas<br>
<b>

iii.Collar</b>
 - it turn around the barrel in order to 
vary size of air hole<br>
<b>

iv.Jet</b>
 – gas pass through it to barrel<br>
<b>

v. Gas </b>
– fuel which burnt to produce flame<br>
<b>

vi.Base</b>
 – give stability to Bunsen burner<br>

<b><br>

How Bunsen produce luminous flame</b><br>


It produce luminous flame when collar turn <br>

to reduce size of air hole to results not 
enough air (oxygen) to complete burn up 
the fuel
<b><br>

How Bunsen Produce Non
 
 Luminous Flame<br></b>


It produce luminous flame when collar turn 
to increase size of air hole to allow enough 
air (oxygen) to complete burn up the fuel
Uses of Luminous flame
<br>
i. It used for light
Uses of Non luminous flame<br>


ii. It used for heating purpose<br>

iii. It used for Flame test of certain chemical 
substance<br>

​Fundamental Unit of Life: <br></b></p>


<br><p>

All known living organisms are made up of one or more cells.<br>
<br>
 Some organisms, like bacteria and yeast, are unicellular (single-celled), while others, like plants and animals, are multicellular (many-celled).  <br>
<br>

​The Cell Theory: This is a cornerstone of biology, stating that:<br>
<br></p>

<p>

​All living organisms are composed of cells.<br>
<br>

​The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life.<br>
<br>

​All cells arise from pre-existing cells.<br>
<br>

​Genetic Material: <br>
<br>
All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which serves as a blueprint for the cell's functions and is passed down to new cells during division.<br>
  </p>

​Types of Cells<br>
<br>

​There are two main categories of cells: <br>
<br><b><p>


 Prokaryotic Cells: </b>
These are the simplest and oldest types of cells.<br>
<br>
 <p>
They lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material floats freely in the cytoplasm. Bacteria and archaea are examples of prokaryotic organisms.<br>
<b>

  Eukaryotic Cells:</b>
 These are more complex and larger.<br>
<br>
 They have a membrane-bound nucleus that contains the DNA and other specialized structures called organelles that perform specific tasks.<br>
<br>
 Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are made of eukaryotic cells.<br>
<br>

  Specialized Human Cells
​The human body contains trillions of cells, with over 200 different types, each with a specialized function.  <br>
<br>

​Red blood cells transport oxygen throughout the body.  <br>
<br>

​Neurons (nerve cells) transmit electrical and chemical signals to communicate with the brain.  <br>
<br>

​Muscle cells are responsible for movement and are organized into tissues like skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.  <br>
<br>

​Skin cells (epithelial cells) form a protective barrier against the external environment.<br>
<br>

​Some cells, like the ovum (egg cell), are among the largest human cells, visible to the naked eye.<br>
<br>
 In contrast, sperm cells are the smallest.</p>

<h2>
ORGANS </h2>       </b>
       </b>       
</p>
   <p>

An organ is a collection of tissues specialized in carrying out a specific function.        <br>

An organ is made up of different types of cells grouped together as a unit eg </p>
       <b>        <br>
 <h3>
i) EYES    </h3>  </b>
 <p>The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the orbit, but the term often includes the adjacent parts. In most invertebrates the years are immovable ocelli, or compound eyes made up of numerous ocelli. See Ocellus. </p>
 <b> Illastrations</b>

 <img src="eye3.jpg" height="300px" width="350px">
<br><b>
 fig 2
<br></b>
<p>
 The eye is made up of several key parts, each with a specific function:
<br><b>

  Cornea: <br></b>

This is the clear, dome-shaped outer layer at the front of the eye. <br>
<br>
It helps to focus light as it enters the eye.<br>
<br>

  Iris: The iris is the colored part of the eye. <br>
<br>
It's a muscle that controls the size of the pupil, regulating how much light enters the eye.<br>
<br>
<b>

  Pupil:<br>
</b>
 This is the black circle in the center of the iris. It's actually an opening that allows light to pass through.<br>
<br>

<b>
  Lens: </b>
<br>
Located behind the iris and pupil, the lens is a transparent structure that fine-tunes the focusing of light onto the retina.<br>
<br>
 It changes shape to focus on objects at different distances.<br>
<b>

  Retina:</b>
<br>
 This is a light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. <br>
<br>
It contains millions of photoreceptor cells, including rods (for low-light vision) and cones (for color vision).<br>
<br>
 The retina converts light into electrical signals.
  <br>
<br><b>

Optic Nerve:</b><br>

 This nerve connects the retina to the brain. <br>
<br>
It transmits the electrical signals from the retina to the visual cortex in the brain, where the signals are processed and interpreted as the images we see.<br>
<br>

How We See
Seeing is a process that involves both the eye and the brain. <br>
<br>
It begins when light rays enter the eye and are focused by the cornea and lens onto the retina.<br>
<br>
 The photoreceptor cells in the retina then convert this light into electrical signals. <br>
<br>
These signals travel along the optic nerve to the brain. The brain's visual cortex receives these signals and flips the image (since the lens projects an inverted image) and combines the information from both eyes to create a single, three-dimensional image. </p>

<h3 id="heart">
THE MAMMALIAN HEART </h3>       </b>
</p>
  <p>   

Its function is to pump blood around the body.        <br>
The whole heart is surrounded by
the pericardium which has two layers between which is the pericardial fluid that
reduce friction between them.</p>
       <br>
<marquee>The heart is made of tissues called cardiac muscles which have the potential to
contract rapidly.       

It’s divided in to four chambers.        
          The upper chambers are called atrium / auricle
and the lower chambers are each called ventricle.     </marquee>  <br>
 <iframe width="350" height="320" src="https://youtu.be/X9ZZ6tcxArI?si=3V2fAXiGT3pNSS0w"allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>
 
The heart is divided in to sections ie left and right by a muscular septum whose
function is to prevent mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood </p>
      <br>
<p>
<legend>Movement of blood in the heart is maintained in a single direction ie from the
auricle to ventricle and then to blood vessels.  </legend>     <br>

       <br>
Blood flow in one direction in the heart is maintained by the presence of valves.
       <br>
       <br>
The auricles receive blood from all parts of the body while the ventricles pump
blood to the body e.g. the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the
pulmonary vein and pump it to the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve.       <br>
       <br>

The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body from the
vena cava and pumps it to the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve.       <br>
       <br>

The ventricle walls are more muscular (have thicker walls) than those or the
auricles because the auricle pump blood to shorter distance i.e. to the ventricle
while the ventricles pump blood longer distances i.e. to body and lungs.       <br>
       <br>

The walls of the left ventricle that pump blood in to the systemic circulation are
thicker than those of the right ventricle which pump blood to pulmonary
circulation.       <br>
       <br>

Flow of blood through the heart
Blood flows in to the heart from the rest of the body via the vena cava to the right
atrium which pumps it to the right ventricle via the tricuspid valveicle walls are more muscular (have thicker walls) than those or the 
auricles because the auricle pump blood to shorter distance i.e. to the ventricle 
while the ventricles pump blood longer distances i.e. to body and lungs.       <br>
       <br>

The walls of the left ventricle that pump blood in to the systemic circulation are 
thicker than those of the right ventricle which pump blood to pulmonary 
circulation.       <br>
       <br>

Flow of blood through the heart     
  
Blood flows in to the heart from the rest of the body via the vena cava to the right 
atrium which pumps it to the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve       <br>
       <br>

 The right ventricle pumps blood to the pulmonary artery to the lungs and blood 
flows back to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein which pumps it to the left 
ventricle via the bicuspid valve and then finally pumped to the rest of the body via 
the aorta.       <br>

       <b> <h3>
THE CARDIAC CYCLE  </h3>     </b>
 <p>

        <br>

This refers to the sequence of events by which the heart pumps and is refilled with 
blood.        <br>
      <br>
 The cardiac cycle involves two phases:       <b> 
       <br>

 Re-filling of the heart with blood       </b>
       <b> 
       <br>

 Pumping of blood          <br>
    </b>

The pumping action of the heart consists of alternate contraction and relaxation of 
cardiac muscles in the walls of the heart.        <br>
Contraction of cardiac muscles is called        <b> 
<u>
Systole</u>     </b>
 while relaxation is called               
<b> <u>
Diastole  </u>    </b>
       <br>

During diastole, the cardiac muscles in the walls of the atria relax and expand;       <br>
        <br>

Blood from the vena cava and pulmonary vein enter the atria and becomes filled 
with blood.  </p>
   <iframe width="350" height="320" src="https://youtu.be/EH6e2JuxAho?si=ElWLd46VHVP1w1pE"allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <br><p>

 The walls of the ventricles relax and expand while those of the atria 
contract, forcing blood from the atria into ventricles via bicuspid and tricuspid 
valves as semilunar valves remain closed.
       <br>
       <b> 
Diagram        </b>
       <br>
       <img src="Diastole.jpg" height="300px" width="350px">

        <br>


During systole, cardiac muscles of the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the 
heart via the semi lunar valves into the aorta and pulmonary artery.        <br>
At this time, 
the atria relax and expand in order to be re-filled with blood.       <br>
 The cuspid valves 
close against high blood pressure to prevent the back flow of blood into the 
auricles.        <br>
The closure of the valves produces the heart sound termed as lub.    <iframe width="350" height="320" src="https://youtu.be/EH6e2JuxAho?si=ElWLd46VHVP1w1pE"allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

       <b> 

Diagram       </b>
 <img src="systole.jpg" height="300px" width="350px">

              <br>
 <br>

After expelling blood, ventricles relax and their pressure lowers compared to aorta 
and pulmonary artery pressure.       <br>

This would cause back flow of blood to the heart but is prevented by sudden 
closure of the semi lunar valves.       <br>
 The closure of the semi lunar valves causes a 
second heart sound called dub.       <br>

The 2 sounds lub and dub are so close and often described as lub-dub and they 
form a single heartbeat.       <br>

Initiation and control of the heart beat
Contraction of the heart is initiated by heart, heart muscles / cardiac muscles 
themselves.       <br>

Therefore the heart muscles are myogenic i.e. the rhythmic contraction a rise from 
within the tissue itself.       <br>
Heart beat is controlled by collection of cells in the right atrium called pacemakers 
located in the sino artrio node (SAN) which are controlled by nervous impulse 
from the medulla oblongata of the brain that change the rate of heart beat.
       <b>        <br>

Factors affecting the heart beat rate       </b>

          <br>
    
Exercise.         <br>
     

Lack of hormones in the body e.g. adrenaline       <br>

State of health and diseases e.g. malaria       <br>

Age i.e. its faster in infants than adults.       <br>

 Body size i.e. it is faster in small organisms than large
Sex i.e. faster in female than in male.       <br>

           <br>
   <b> 
NB:        <br>
       </b>
In normal adults at rest, heart contracts about 70 / 72 times per minute.       <br>
       <b id="bloodp"> 

BLOOD PRESSURE       <br>
       </b>

This is the force with which blood flows from one part of the body to another.        <br>
 <img src="pressure.jpg" height="310px" width="350px">
</p>
 <p>

The 
blood pressure is due to the pumping action of the heart as experienced by the 
blood vessels.        <br>
The narrow blood vessels experience high blood pressure and wide 
vessels experience low blood pressure.       <br>
 Sometimes fats accumulate in the blood 
vessels making their rumens narrow.       <br>
 This increases blood pressure and it is the 
major cause of high blood pressure in fat people, however small people also 
experience high blood pressure.        <br>
This is due to conditions like stress, anxiety, fear, 
etc.       <br>
 These conditions tend to increase the rate of heartbeat and more blood is 
pumped to the blood vessels causing high pressure in them.     </p>

The concentration of red blood cells increases as one climbs up a mountain 
because the concentration of oxygen in the air reduces with increase in height 
above sea level.       <br>
       <br>
 So the body adopts by producing more red cells to increase the 
available total surface area to bind and carry oxygen to the tissues regardless the 
reducing oxygen concentration main.       <br>

Red blood cells are made from the red bone marrow of short bones in adults and in 
the foetus, red blood cells are made in the liver.       <br>       <br>

 They last for approximately four 
months after which they are taken to the liver or spleen for their destruction.         <br>
     <br>
 They 
are more numerous than any other cells in the blood.       <br>       <br>

 Red blood cells are 
responsible for transporting oxygen in the body.       <br>

Characteristics of white blood cells           </b>
   <br>       <br>


i) They have no definite shape (they are amoeboid)       <br>       <br>


ii) They have a nucleus even at maturity.        <br>
      <br>

iii)They are relatively few in blood but their number increases when the body is 
attached by an infection.       <br>       <br>


iv) They lack haemoglobin.       <br>       <br>


v) They feed on foreign particles by  <b>Phagocytes         </b>
     <br>       <br>


White blood cells are divided into two major categories.These are;
         <b> 
     <br>
<br>1. Phagocytes.       </b>
 These are white blood cells with a lobed nucleus. They ingest 
and destroy germs by phagocytes.           <br>
   <br>
        <b> 

2. Lymphocytes.        </b>
These are white blood cells, which defend the body by 
producing antibodies.       <br>       <br>

       <b>

       <b> 

Production of red and white blood cells       </b>
       <br>

The red blood cells are manufactured form the red bone marrows in adults.       <br>       <br>

 Old red 
blood cells are taken to the liver for destruction.       <br>
       <br>

White blood cells are manufactured from the white bone marrows of long bones.         <br>
      <br>

Some white blood cells are manufactured from the lymph nodes.         <br>
      <br>
Worn out white 
blood cells are also taken to the liver for destruction.         <br>
      <br>
In the foetus, the liver 
manufactures blood cells.             <br>
 <br>

Action of white blood cells on the foreign particles
Some white blood cells attack and destroy the foreign particles directly by 
themselves.         <br>
      <br>
These are called phagocytes and they destroy the foreign particles by 
Phagocytosis.        <br>
      <br>
 In this process the white blood cells form pseudopodia, which they 
use to engulf the foreign particle by Phagocytosis.       <br>       <br>

 
After engulfing the foreign particle, a food vacuole is formed into which digestive 
enzymes are produced.        <br>       <br>

The enzymes break down the particle and the important 
materials are absorbed by the white blood cell while the wastes are excreted out of 
the cell through the contractile vacuole.       <br></p>
<p>


       <b> 

Illustration of Phagocytosis
       <br>
            </b>       <br>

Some white blood cells destroy foreign particles by releasing antibodies, which 
destroy the particles.       <br>
 White blood cells, which produce antibodies, are called 
lymphocytes.        <br>
There are four types of antibodies produced.       </b>
       <b> 
       <br>

1) Opsonins;        <br>
      </b>
 these attach to the outer surface of the foreign particle and make it 
easier for phagocytic white blood cells to ingest them.         <br>
     <b> 

2) Agglutinins;       <br>
        </b>
these cause the foreign particles to stick together.        <br>
In this condition 
the foreign particles cannot invade the tissues.       <br>
       <b> 

3) Lysins;       <br>
       </b>
 these destroy bacteria by dissolving their outer coats.       <br>

4)       <b> 
Anti-toxins;       </b>
       <br>
 these combine with and so neutralize the toxins produced by 
foreign particles.       <br>
       <b> 
<h3>THE PLATELETS (THROMBOCYTES)</h3>
       </b>
       <br><p>

These are blood cells formed as fragments in the bone marrows during the 
formation of red blood cells.       <br>

Characteristics of platelets
       </b>       <br>

1. They are cell fragments.       <br>

2. They are spherical in shape.       <br>

3. They do not have a nucleus.       <br>

4. They do not have        <b>

Functions:       </b>       <br>


They play a role in blood clotting which protects the body against excessive loss of 
blood and entry of pathogens through the injured part.        <br>       <b> 

Blood clotting       </b>
 is the process by which blood stops oozing out of a cut or wound

    </b> 
       <br><p>


1. It prevents excessive loss of blood from the body.       <br>

2. It is a step towards healing of cuts and wounds.       <br>

3. The blood clot creates a barrier to prevent entry of bacteria and other pathogens 
in the body.       <br>

The Process of Blood Clotting:
When blood is exposed to air as a result of a cut or wound, the platelets in the 
blood at the damaged tissue stimulate the release of a chemical called        <b> 

thromboplastin (thrombokinase).       </b>
 In the presence of calcium ions and vitamin 
K, thromboplastin stimulates the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin 
enzyme.          <br>
    <br>
 Thrombin then catalyzes the conversion of soluble blood protein 
fibrinogen to the insoluble form fibrin.         <br>
     <br></p>
<p>
<p>

 Fibrin forms fibers, which form a mesh 
and trap blood cells and proteins.          <br>
     <br>
This mesh dries to form a scab, which is called 
the blood clot.         <br>
      <br>

<p>
<p>

The mammalian eye is a receptor organ responsible for sight.            <br>
  <br><p>

 It contains 
photoreceptor cells, which perceive the light stimulus and change it into nervous 
impulse.       <br>
       <b>

       <br>       <b> 
<p style="text-align:center;">
Parts of the eye    </p>     </b>
      
     <b> 
     
<p>

1. The conjunctiva:       </b>
       <br>

This is a thin transparent layer lining the inside of the eyelidIt protects the eye and holds it in position.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

It enables the eye ball to move easily by secreting mucus.       <b> 
       <br>

2. The sclera:           <br><p>

   </b>
<p>

This is a tough inelastic layer that gives shape to the eye.       <br>
       <br>

It protects the inner most delicate parts.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

It provides attachment for the muscles of the eye.       <b> 
    <br>

3. The cornea:       </b>
       <br>
<p>

This is a transparent layer in front of the eye. 
It refracts (bends) light into the eye.       <b> 
       <br>

4. The choroid layer:       </b>
       <br>

It is below the sclerotic layer.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

It is pigmented and mainly contains black pigment which stops reflection of 
light rays.       <br>
       <br>

It prevents internal reflection of light.       <br>
  <p>
     <br>

This contains a network of blood vessels supplying oxygen and food to the 
eye.       <br>
       <b> 

5. The aqueous humour:       </b>
       <br>
<p>

It is a solution of sugar, salts and proteins.       <br>

The aqueous humor is a watery fluid which maintains the shape of the eye.        <br>
<p>

It also refracts light into the pupil and the lens.       <b> 
       <br>

6. The vitreous humuor:       </b>
       <br>
<p>

It is a jelly-like substance that fills the inner cavity of the eye.       <br>
     <p>
  <br>
<p>

It is transparent and maintains the shape of the eye.       <br>
       <br>

It refracts light to the retina.       <b> 
       <br>

7. The ciliary body:       <br>
       </b>

This contains ciliary muscles, which control the size of the lens during 
viewing nearby or distant objects.       <br>
       <b> 

8. The lens.          </b>
    <br>
<p>

It is transparent and held by suspensory ligaments.       <br>
       <br>

It refracts light to make an image on the retina.       <br>       <b> 
       <br>

9. The iris       </b>

This is made up of an opaque tissue the center of which is a hole called pupil 
that allows in light to form an image on the retina.       <br>
       <br>
 
The contraction of the muscles of the iris increases the size of the pupil and 
relaxation decreases the size of the pupil.        <br>
       </b>

It is therefore responsible for controlling the amount of light entering the 
eye.        <br>
       <br>
      <b>       <b> 

10.The retina       </b>
          </b>
    <br>

This is a layer containing photoreceptor cells (light sensitive cells)
There are two types of light sensitive cells on the retina
       <b> 
i) Rods       <br>

ii) Cones         </b>
     <br>
<p>

The cones are sensitive to coloured light and are responsible for colour 
vision.        <br>
       <br>
They are also sensitive to light of high intensity and are used during 
daytime.        <br>
       <br>

Most cones on the retina are concentrated on the fovea or yellow spot.       <br>
       <br>

The rods are incapable of perceiving coloured light and are sensitive to light 
of low intensity (dim light). They are used during night vision.       <br>
       <br>
 
Nerve fibers from the photoreceptor cells run to the brain via the optic nerve.        <br>
       <br>

The rods contain a pigment rhodopsin which is rapidly bleached by even a 
small amount of light but at the same time it is rapidly generated.       <br>
       <br>
 <p>

The cones contain a pigment called       <b> 
 iodopsin        </b>
which is less sensitive to light 
and is not bleached so quickly.       <br>
       <br>

The retinas of nocturnal animals have mainly rods.       <br>
       <br>
 Due to this, nocturnals 
can’t perceive different colours       <br>
       <br>
.
Therefore the retina is where the image is formed in the eye.       <br>
       <br>
       <b> 
<p>

11.Pupil.       <br>
       </b>

This is a round black hole in the center of the eye lying behind the cornea.       <br>
       <br>
 It 
allows light to pass into the eye to the lens.       <br>
       <b> 

12.Suspensory ligaments.       <br>       </b>

       

These are inelastic fibers that hold the lens in position.       <br>
       <br>
       <b> 

13.The blind spot       </b>

       <br>
This is a region where the nerve fibers leave the eye to enter the optic nerve. 
It has no light sensitive cells.       <br>
 When an image falls on this point, it is not 
taken to the brain thus blind spot.       <br>
       <b> 
<p>

14.The fovea         </b>
     <br>

This is a small depression in the center of the retina.       <br>
 It has only cones in a 
high concentration.       <br>
 It is therefore a region on the retina that contains the 
largest number of sensory cells.       <br>
 Due to this, it produces the most accurate 
images in the eye.       <br>       <b> 


15.Eye lids          </b>
    <br>

These protect the eye and remove any foreign bodies that enter it.          <br><p>

     <br>
Regular 
blinking enables the spread of the fluid all over the exposed surface of the 
eye.          <b> 
    <br>

16.Eye lashes         </b>
     <br>

They prevent dust particles and other objects from entering the eye.       <br>       <b id="form"> 

      </b>
       <br>
       <img src="eye5.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

       <br>

Light from an external object enters the eye. It is refracted by the cornea into the 
aqueous humour.        <br>
       <br>
The aqueous humour then refracts it to the lens.        <br>
       <br>
The lens 
refracts it to the vitreous humour.       <br>
       <br>
 The vitreous humour finally refracts light and 
focuses it to the retina making an image on the retina.       <br>
       <br>
 The photoreceptors in the 
retina change the light stimulus into a nervous impulse.       <br>
       <br>
 The impulse travels 
along the optic nerve to the brain where interpretation of the image is made.        <br>
       <br>
The 
image formed on the retina is smaller to the real object and it is upside down.           <br>

CONTROL OF LIGHT AMOUNT ENTERING THE EYE       <br>
       <br>

The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye.   <p>
     <br>
       <br>
It is made up of circular 
and radial musclesWhen the circular muscles of the iris contract, the size of the pupil is reduced 
and less light is allowed in. <br>
<br>

Contraction of the radial muscles widens the pupil so allowing more light to 
enter the eye. <br>
<br>

In light of low intensity, the pupil widens and in bright light, the pupil reduces 
in size. <br>
<br>
This is done to protect the retina from damage by bright light and the 
wide size of the pupil during dim light allows in enough light of low intensity. <br>
<br><p>


Control of the amount of light rays entering the eye when in dim light:<br>

In dim light, radial muscles contract,
Circular muscles relax,
Pupil widens and more light is admitted into the eye.

ACCOMMODATION OF THE EYE<br>
</b></center>
<br>

This is the ability of the eye to change the focal length of the lens when viewing 
distant or nearby objects.<br><p>

<br>

Accommodation for a nearby object:
When looking at a nearby object, the ciliary muscles in the ciliary body 
contract, the suspensory ligaments slacken.<br>
<br>
 This makes the lens short and thick.
 <br>  <p>
 
 <br>

 This increases the ability of the lens to refract light and reduces the focal length 
of the lens for the nearby object to be seen clearly.
<b>
<center>
Illustration<br>
<br></center>
</b><br>


Accommodation for a distant object:
When viewing a distant object, the ciliary muscles in the ciliary body relax. <br><p>

<br>

This causes tension in the suspensory ligaments.<br>
<br>
 The suspensory ligaments pull 
the lens apart making the lens thin and long. <br>
<br>
This makes the lens to refract less 
and increase the focal length of the lens.<br>

EYE DEFECTS</b>
<br></center>
<p>

An eye defect is a condition where the eye fails to focus an object well unless 
aided by external lenses.<br>
<br>
 
The common eye defects include:
1. Short sightedness (myopia):
This is usually caused by a large eyeball or a very strong lens.<br>
<br>
 Light from a 
distant object is focused in front of the retina.<br>
<br><p>

 The individual can only see 
nearby object but not distant ones.<br>
<b>

<center>

 <br></b></center>
<img src="short.jpg" height="280px" width="350px">

<p>


<br><br>


This can be corrected by putting on diverging (concave) lenses.<br>

<b>
<center>
Illustration<br></center></b><p>

       <img src="short1.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">



2. Long sightedness (hypermetropia):
This is caused by a small or short eyeball or a very weak lens such that a close 
object is focused far behind the retina. <br>
<br><p>

The individual can see distant objects but 
cannot see nearby objects.<br>

<b>
<center>
Illustration<br></center></b>
        



Long sightedness can be corrected by wearing converging (convex) lenses

         <img src="long.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

 3. Astigmatism <br>
<br>
</b>

This is caused by unequal refraction of the cornea and lens due to uneven 
curving in them.<br>
<br>
 It results into some parts of the object being well focused on 
the retina and some not to be focused.<br>
<br><p>

 It is normally due to old age. This can be 
solved by wearing cylindrical lenses.<br>
<br>
<b><p>


4. Presbyopia<br>
 </b>

This condition occurs when the lens hardens due to old age and does not focus. <br>
<br>
<p>

It can be corrected by wearing spectacles with convex lenses or often 2 pairs of 
spots may be necessary i.e. a pair with convex lenses for close vision and a pair 
of concave lenses for distant vision or the 2 types of lenses can be combined 
into one pair known as bi-focal spectacles.<br>
<br><p>

<b>

5. Cataract<br></b>


It is a condition which occurs when an individual is aging. <br>
<br><p>

It is caused by the 
eye lens becoming opaque due to a thin covering formed on it.<br>
<br>
 It is corrected by 
surgical removal of the thin opaque layer of the lens.<br><p>

<br>

Other eye defects include trachoma, conjunctivitis, colour blindness and 
glaucoma.<br>
<br>

Colour vision
The cones are photoreceptor cells on the retina, which are concerned with 
colour vision. <br>
<br><p>

There are three types of cones, which are sensitive to three 
primary colours i.e. the blue sensitive cone, green sensitive cone and red 
sensitive cone.<br>
<br><p>

 When blue sensitive cones alone are stimulated, blue colour is 
perceived.<br>
<br>
 Stimulation of green alone gives green colour.<br>
<br>
 Stimulation of red 
cones produces red colour. <br>
<br>
Equal stimulation of both green and red gives yellow 
colour.<br>
<br>
 Equal stimulation of the entire three gives white colour and when no 
cone is stimulated, no colour (black) is perceived.<br>
<br>
 This is known as the 
<b>trichromatic theory.</b>

<center><h3 id="ear"> THE MAMMALIAN EAR</h3></center>
<br>
Ear: the sense organ for hearing and equilibrium
<br>
<marquee>Ear: That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an animal; any prominence or projection on an object, -- usually one for support or attachment; a lug; a handle; as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or dish. The ears of a boat are outside kneepieces near the bow. See Illust. of Bell.</marquee>
<br><b>

<center> Structure of the ear</center></b>
<img src="ear.jpg" height="300px" width="350px">
<img src="ear1.jpg" height="300px" width="350px">

The ear has sensory receptors for hearing and balancing.<br>
<br>
 These are mechano-receptors because they respond to pressure and gravity. <br>
<br>
The ear is made up 
of three areas i.e. the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear.<br>
<br>
 1. The outer ear:<br>

This is the tube opening to the side of the head and inwards stopping at the 
eardrum. <br>
<br><p>

It has an outer extension called the pinna. <br>
<br>
The pinna concentrates 
and directs the sound vibrations into the ear through the auditory canal.<br>
<br>
 This 
makes the ear drum to vibrate.<br>
<br>

2. The middle ear:<br>

This is a cavity in the skull filled with air.<br>
<br>
 It communicates with the mouth 
cavity through the Eustachian tube. <br>
<br>
There are three small bones called 
ossicles in the middle ear which link the eardrum and the opening of the 
skull called oval window that leads to the inner ear.<br>
<b>

3. The inner ear:</b>

The inner ear is filled with a fluid and consists of mainly a coiled tube 
known as the cochlea. <br>
The cochlea has sensory nerve endings leading to the 
brain. These transmit nervous impulses from the ear to the brain.<br>

Functions of parts of the ear<b>

1. Pinna:<br>

2. Ear ossicles:<br>
</b>

These are 3 tiny bones in the middle ear. They are:
<b><br>

 Malleus (hammer)<br>

 Incus (anvil)<br>

Stapes (stirrup)<br>
</b>

They are joined like a chain and they transmit sound vibrations across the 
middle ear from the ear drum to the oval window. <br>
<br>
They amplify sounds of low 
tones.<b>
<br>

3. Eustachian tube:</b>
<br>

It connects the middle ear to the pharynx of the mouth.<br>
<br>

Its function is to equalize air pressure on both sides of the ear drum so that it 
can vibrate freely.<br>
<br>

It opens when one is swallowing and yawning.<br>
<br>

It prevents the eardrum from bulging.<br>
<br>

The Eustachian tube is used to balance the pressure inside the ear with that 
outside the ear
 When the pressure of air in the middle ear is higher than that of the atmosphere, 
yawning takes place and air escapes from the middle ear through the Eustachian 
tube to the mouth where it is lost.<br>
<br>
 This reduces the pressure back to normal. 
When the pressure of air in the middle ear is lower than that of the atmosphere, 
yawning takes place to allow the atmospheric air to go into the middle ear 
through the mouth and Eustachian tube. <br>
<br>
This raises the pressure back to normal.<br>
<br>
<b>

4. Oval window (fenestra ovalis):</b>

It is a flexible membrane which vibrates and sets up vibrations in the fluids of 
the ear called perilymph in the cochlea.<br>
<br>

It receives impulses from the steps and transmits them to the cochlea.<br>
<b>

5. Round window (fenestra rotunda):<br></b>


It is a flexible membrane which controls the displacement in the cochlea created 
by vibrations of ossicles by releasing pressure when it bulges out wards.<br>
<b>
<center>
Structure of the semi-circular canals and cochlea </center></b>
<b>

<img src="canal2.jpg" height="250px" width="350px">
6. Cochlea:</b><br>


It is a 3 chambered fluid filled tube which is coiled. <br>
<br>
It contains sensory cells 
which pick up vibrations in the fluid and transmit them to the auditory nerve.<br>
<br>

The sound vibrations move along the auditory nerve and reach the brain where 
they are interpreted as sound.media<br><br>

      Its 3 chambers include:<b>
    <br>i) Vestibular canal (scala vestibuliIt is the upper canal which starts     from the oval window.<br>
<br>
 It contains 
perilymph.<br>

    ii) Tympani canal (scala tympani)<br>
<br>

       It is the lower canal which ends in a smaller membrane called the round 
window.<br><br>

 It also contains perilymph.
<br><br>

iii) Middle canal (scala media)</b>
<br><br>


It is located between the vestibular and tympanic canal.<br>
<br>
 It is filled with a 
fluid called <b>
endolymph.</b><p>

 It contains sensory cells which detect sound. These 
cells form the hearing apparatus called the organ of corti.<br>
 <br>
The organ of corti 
is connected to the auditory nerve.<br>

Cross section of a cochlea<b><br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

7. Semi-circular canal (organ of balance):<br>
</b>

These are 3 semicircular canals which are at right angles to each other. <br>
<br>
They 
contain a fluid called endolymph.<br>
<br>
 At one end of the canal, there is a swelling 
called<b>
 ampulla.</b>
 It contains sensory cells.<br>
<br>

When the person moves the head or whole body, the endolymph, in the semi-circular canals moves in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
 The moving fluid strikes the 
sensory hair cells which are stimulated and sends impulses to the brain. <br>
<br>

    The 3 semicircular canals give information about the direction of movement of 
the body e.g. if a person spins around in one direction and then stops suddenly, 
the fluid continues to flow around the sensory hair cells.<br>
<br>
 This gives a sensation 
of the ground spin around of the group spinning in the opposite direction.<br>

Section through the ampulla
<br>
<br><br>
The process of hearing
Sound waves are collected and concentrated into the ear by the pinna.<br>
<br>

They are then directed to the tympanic membrane (ear drum) through the 
auditory canal. <br>
<br>

This causes the eardrum to vibrate. <br>
<br>

The vibrations of the eardrum are amplified and transmitted by three ossicles 
starting from the malleus, incurs and finally the stapes hands them over the oval 
window that leads to the inner ear.<br>
<br>

Vibrations in the oval window make the fluid in the inner ear and cochlea to 
vibrate. <br>
<br>

Receptors in the cochlea (organ of corti) receive the information, change it into 
impulses and the impulses are taken to the brain via the auditory nerve. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>

  <h3 id="balance">
The process of balancing<br>
<br>
</h3><p>


The semi-circular canals, utriculus and sacculus in the inner ear are all 
concerned with the sense of balance and positioning. 
The three semi-circular canals are filled with a fluid and each lies in a different 
plane. <br>
<br>

One is horizontal and two are vertical but at right angles to each other. 
At the end of each semi-circular canal is a swelling known as the ampulla, 
which contains sensory cells. <br>
<br>

Within the ampulla is a structure covered by sensory cells with hairs on their 
upper surfaces. <br>
<br><p>

The hairs are embedded in a corner of jerry known as cupulla. <br>
<br>

The semicircular canals are stimulated by rotation of the head and body in their 
respective planes.<br>
<br><p>


The utriculus and sacculus have gelatinous plates in their fluid filled cavities, 
which contain granules called <b>
otoliths. </b>
<br>
<br>

The otoliths are attached to sensory fibres. <br>
<br>
When the head is tilted, the otoliths 
pull on the sensory fibres. <br>
<br>
This causes an impulse to be fired off from these 
organs to the brain.<br>
<br>
 A reflex is then set off which causes the body to return to its 
normal posture.
<br><p>

<b>
Note:</b>
<br>
The utriculus responds to vertical movement of the head while the succulus 
responds to lateral movement of the head.<br>

 <br><br>
<h3 id="disorder">Common ear disorders</h3>
<b>


1. Ear ache and ear discharge:<br>
</b>

It is usually due to an inflammation in the middle ear.<br>
<br><p>


It occurs when microorganisms reach the middle ear via the Eustachian tube. <br>
<br>

Due to severe inflammation, pus may be formed in the middle ear and the ear 
drum become perforated.<br>
<br>
 The discharge may lead to permanent deafness.<br>
<b><br>
<br>


2. Deafness:</b>

This is caused by accumulation and hardening of wax in the outer auditory 
canal which presses against the eardrum.<br>
<br>

Blocking of the Eustachian tube, exposure to loud noise over a long period of <p>

time can damage the organ of corti leading to deafness.
<br>
<br>
Also damage to the cochlea or the hearing centre of the brain can also cause 
deafness.<br>
<br><h3>Common Ear Disorders</h3><br>
<h3>Otitis Media</h3><p>Also known as a middle ear infection, often caused by a virus or bacteria.</p><br>
<b>Tinnitus</b><p>A sensation of ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the ears that isn't caused by an external sound.</p><br>
<b>Swimmer's Ear (Otitis Externa)</b><p>An infection of the outer ear canal, usually caused by water remaining in the ear after swimming.</p><br>
<b>Ménière's Disease</b><p>A disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss.</p><br>
<b>Hearing Loss</b><p>Can be gradual due to aging (presbycusis) or sudden, caused by noise exposure, injury, or illness.</p><br>
<b>Earwax Impaction</b><p>An excessive buildup of earwax that blocks the ear canal and can cause hearing loss or pain.</p>

<p>

Growth is defined as an irreversible or permanent increase in the size and dry 
weight of an organism.<br>
<br>
 Growth in multicellular organisms is divided into 3 
phases.<br>
<br>
<b>

1. Cell division</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>

This involves increase in the number of cells mainly as a result of mitosis.
<b><br>

2. Cell expansion</b>
<br>

This is the permanent increase in the cell size as a result of uptake of water or 
synthesis of living materials.<br>
<br>
<b>

3. Cell differentiation</b>
<br>

This involves specialization of cells to suit particular functions.<br>
<br>
 Growth is 
usually accompanied by an increase in the complexity of an organism which is 
also called development.<br>
<br>

<b>
Development </b>
is the increase in complexity and change of form of an organism.

<br>
       <center style="font-size:16pt;"><b>Structure of the skin</b>
       </center>
          <img src="skin1.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

<br>
The skin consists of two main layers.<br>
 <br>

1. The epidermis (outer layer)<br>
<br>

2. The dermis (inner layer)
<b>
THE EPIDERMIS:</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>

This is made up of three sub layers.<br>

a) The Malpighian layer.<br>
<br>

b) The granular layer.<br>
<br>

c) The cornified layer.<br>
<br>
<b>
<u>
1) The Malpighian layer</b>
<br></u>
<br>

This is the inner most sub layer in the epidermis.<br>
<br>
 It consists of dividing cells 
which give rise to cells of the granular layer.<br>
<br><p>

 It secretes a pigment called melanin, which gives the skin its colour and protects the skin from ultraviolent 
rays. <br>
<br>
Albinos do not produce melanin in their skins.<br>
<br>
<b>
<u>
2) The granular layer</b>
<br></u>
<br>
<p>

This contains living cells arising from the malphigian layer. <br>
<br>
It is the biggest 
layer of the epidermis. <br>
<br>
It gives rise to cells of the cornified layer.<br>
<br>
<b>
<u>
3) The cornified layer</b>
<br></u>
<br>
.
This is the outermost layer of the skin. <br>
<br>
It is made up of dead cells, which are 
keratinized.<br>
<br>
 Cells of this layer continuously ware away and are replaced by cells 
from the granular layer.<br>
<br>
 Its function is to protect the inner parts of the body 
from mechanical injury and entry of bacteria and other germs.<br>
<br>
 It also offers 
water proofing to the skin.<b><br>


THE DERMIS:</b><br>
<br>
<p>


This is the inner layer of the skin.<br>
<br>
 It is below the Malpighian layer. <br>
<br>
It is thicker 
than the epidermis.<br>
<br>
 It contains the sweat glands, nerve fibers, fat cells and blood 
capillaries. <br>
<br>

Other parts of the skin
1) Hairs.<br>
<br>

The hairs extend from the dermis through the epidermis. <br>
<br>
They arise from hair 
follicles in the dermis.<br>
<br>
 They protect the body and trap a layer of air on the skin, 
which insulates the body against heat loss.<br>
<br>
<b>

2) Sebaceous gland </b>
<br>
<br>

This secretes an oily substance called sebum.<br>
<br>
 This oil softens the cornified layer 
and prevents it from cracking.<br>
<br>
 The oil also provides water proofing to the skin.<br>
<b><br>
<br>


3) Nerve endings.</b>
These perceive external stimuli and transport impulses to the central nervous 
system.<br>
<br>
<b>

4) Sweat glands.</b>
<br>

These are coiled tubular glands located in the dermis. <br>
<br>
They excrete sweat, 
which is released out of the skin through the sweat duct.<br>

CONTROL OF BODY TEMPERATURE (Temperature regulation).</h3></b><br>
<br>         <img src="heat.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

 <p>

This is the process of maintaining the temperature of the organism within 
narrow ranges, which favour body activity, and ensures optimum activity of 
body enzymes.<br>
<br>

To maintain the body temperature constant, there must be a balance between 
heat loss and heat gain. 
The body loses heat by;<b>
<br>
<br>

a) Radiation: </b>
Heat diffuses from the warm body to the cold environment.<b>
<br>
<br>

b) Conduction: </b>
The body loses heat to the cold object in contact with it.
<b><br>
<br>

c) Convection: </b>
Where cold air or wind carries heat from the warm body.<b>
<br>
<br>

d) Evaporation:</b>
 e.g. sweating leading to loss of heat<br>
<br>

The body gains heat by;<b>
<br>
<p>

a) Radiation: </b>
e.g. from the sun’s heat and reflection from the ground.<br>
<br>
<b>

b) Conduction: </b>

e.g. from the ground via the feet.<b>
<br>
<br>

c) Convection: </b>

e.g. from the wind bringing hot air to the body.<b><br>
<br>
<p><p>


d) Metabolism: </b><br>

e.g. since many of the body’s chemical reactions release heat 
e.g. in respiration.<br>

The rate of heat loss and gain depends on;<b>

a) Surface area to volume ratio </b>
i.e. <br>

Small organisms having a large surface area to volume ration tend to lose 
more heat than the large ones with small surface area to volume ratio.
<b><br>
<br>

b) Temperature of surrounding environment:</b>

Organisms tend to lose more heat in cold environment and gain more in hot 
environment.<br>
<b>

c) Rate of respiration<br></b>
<p>


The higher the rate of respiration, the more heat energy gained by the body.
 <br>
<br>
<b>
d) Humidity of the environment</b>

Heat loss increases in humid conditions because high humidity makes the 
environment colder.<br>
<br>

Endothermic/Homoithermic animals:<br>
<b></p>

<p>
 
Endothermic organisms </b>
are those that are able to maintain a constant body 
temperature irrespective of the surrounding environmental temperature.
<br>
<br>
They depend mainly on heat generated within their bodies. <br>
<br>
They are also called 
warm blooded animals e.g. mammals.<br><br><b>

Ectothermic/poiklothermic animals:</b><br>


These are animals that cannot maintain a constant body temperature but their 
temperature changes with that of the environment.<br>
<br>
 They are also called cold 
blooded animals e.g. reptiles and amphibians.

The body temperature of ectotherms varies with environmental temperature.
<br>
<br>
Control of body temperature in endotherms
When temperature is high, organisms respond in a way that lowers down the 
temperature and when the temperature is low, organisms respond in a way that 
raises their body temperature. <br>
<br>
These responses are categorized into two types.<br>
<br><b>
<p>


1. Physiological responses.</b><br>

 These are involuntary actions and they occur in 
body organs in response to temperature changes.<br>
<br>
<b>

2. Behavioral responses.</b>
<br>
 These are voluntary responses from the organism. <br>
<br>

The organism consciously decides what to do when external and internal 
temperatures change.<br>
<br>

Response to cold weather in endothermic animals
Physiological means.<br>
<br>
<b>
1.The erector pill muscles </b>
of the hair contract to make the hairs stand upright 
to the skin. <br>
<br>
The hairs trap a layer of air, which insulates the skin.<br>
<br>

2. The rate of sweating reduces in order to reduce on the amount of heat lost 
through it.<br>
<br>

3. The metabolic activity of the liver increases to produce energy in form of 
heat<br>
<br>

<p>

4. Blood vessels near the skin constrict in the process called vasoconstriction to 
reduce on the blood reaching the skin.<br>
<br>
 This reduces heat loss through 
radiation.<br>
<br>

5. Small animals like the mouse undergo hibernation where they dig holes and 
live deep in them to reduce heat loss<br>
<br>
<b>

6. Shivering. </b>
This is the rhythmic contractions of the skeletal muscles. It results 
into production of heat energy.<br>
<br>
<b>

Behavioral means.</b>

Endotherms may raise their body temperature behaviorally through;<br>

1. Sitting near hot bodied to raise their body temperature by conduction or 
radiation.<br>
<br>

2. Humans take hot drinks.<br><br>


3. They do physical exercises to raise the metabolic activity of the body.<br>
<br>

4. They can take a hot bath<br>
<br>
<p>

5. They put on thick clothes, which insulate their bodies.<br>
<br>
<b>

In hot weather</b>

In hot environment, animals control the body temperature by increasing heat 
loss and lowering heat production through the following ways:<br>
<b>

Physiological means.</b>

1. The erecter pilli muscle of the skin relaxes making the hairs to fall on the 
skin.<br>
<br>
<p>
 This allows heat loss by radiation.<br>
<br>
<p>
2. The metabolic rate of the body reduces to reduce on the amount of heat 
produced.<br>
<br>

3. Sweating increases. In this process excessive heat is lost as latent heat of 
vaporization to evaporate the sweat from the body hence losing heat.<br>
<br>
<b>

4. Vasodilatation. </b>
Vessels dilate and allow more blood to reach the skin surface 
in order to lose heat to the surroundings by radiation.
<br>
<br>
5. Animals living in hot environments have a thin fat layer to reduce on the 
insulation.<br>
<br>
<b>

Behavioral means.</b>
<br>

1. Some rest on cold bodies like rocks to lose heat by conduction.<br>
<br>

2. Humans sit near fans.<br>
<br>

3. Some take cold drinks.<br>
<br>

4. They put on light clothes
<br>
<br>
<b><p>

5. Panting.</b>
 This involves hanging out of the tongue for example in dogs.<br>
<br>
 This 
results into evaporation from the mouth, which eventually cools the animal.<br>
<br>
<b>
<p>

6. Swimming</b><br>
Adaptations of mammals to cold conditions<br>
<br>
<p>
1. They have a lot of hairs over their bodies to trap a layer of air<br>
<br>

2. They have a thick fat layer to act as an insulator.<br>
<br>

3. Some are very big and thus have a small surface area to volume ratio. This 
reduces the rate of heat loss.<br>
<br>

4. They have few sweat glands to reduce of the heat lost during sweating<br>
<br>

5. They have fewer blood vessels on the skin surface to avoid heat loss through 
radiation.<br>
<br>
<b>

Behavioral:</b><br>


1. Putting on thick clothes like in humans<br>

2. Doing physical exercises<br>
<b>

3. Hibernation. <br>
</b>
This is a state of long rest by burrowing into crevices and holes 
during extreme coldness.<br>
<br>

4. Sun bathing
Adaptations to hot conditions<br>
<br>

1. Having little hairs on the body to allow easy loss of heat.<br>
<br>

2. Having less fat to reduce on the insulation effect of fats.<br>
<br>

3. Having a large surface area to volume ratio. To allow a faster rate of heat 
loss.<br>
<br>
<p>

4. Having a lot of sweat glands to increase heat loss.<br>
<br>

5. Having many blood vessels near the skin for easy loss of heat by radiation.<b>
<br>
<br>

Behavioral:</b>
<br>

1. Resting under shade.<br>

2. Bathing cold water.<br>

3. Aestivation.<br>
 This is a state of long rest by burrowing in crevices and holes 
during extreme hotness.<br>

4. Putting on lighter clothes.<br>

5. Sitting near cold things.<br>

          <img src="stomach.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">
 <br>

 <p>

The stomach is a remarkable and vital organ in the digestive system.<br>
<br>
 It's a J-shaped, muscular organ located between the esophagus and the small intestine.<br>
<br><marquee>Stomach acid, primarily hydrochloric acid, is so powerful that it could burn your skin. To protect itself from this corrosive substance, the stomach is lined with a thick layer of mucus. If this protective barrier wears down, it can lead to painful stomach ulcers.  </marquee>

<p>


 Its primary role is to act as a temporary holding pouch for food, but it also performs several critical functions in the process of digestion.<br>
<br>

​Here are some key aspects of the stomach:<b>

​1. Anatomy:</b>

​Fundus:<br>
 The upper, rounded part of the stomach.<b>
<p>

​Body (Corpus):</b>
<br>
 The main central part.<b>

​Antrum:</b>
<br>
 The lower part of the stomach that leads to the small intestine.<b>

​Pylorus:</b>
<br>
 The muscular valve at the end of the stomach that controls the flow of food into the small intestine.<b>

​2. Digestion:</b>
<br>
<b>
<p>

​Mechanical Digestion:</b>
 <br>
The muscular walls of the stomach contract and relax in a process called peristalsis.<br>
<br>
 This churning action breaks down food into a semifluid mixture known as chyme.<b>

​Chemical Digestion:</b>
 <br>
<p>

The stomach's lining contains millions of glands that secrete gastric juice. This juice is a powerful cocktail of substances, including:<br>
<br><b>


​Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):</b>
 This acid has a pH of 1.5 to 3.5, which is highly acidic. It kills bacteria and other pathogens that may have been ingested with food. It also helps to denature proteins, preparing them for digestion.<br>
<br>
<b></p>
<p>


​Pepsinogen:</b>
 This is an inactive enzyme that is converted into pepsin by the hydrochloric acid.<br>
<br>
 Pepsin is a protease, meaning it breaks down proteins into smaller peptides.<br>
<b>

​Mucus:</b>
 <br>
A thick layer of mucus coats the stomach lining, protecting it from being digested by its own acid and enzymes.<br>
<br><b>


​3. Absorption:</b>
<br>

While the small intestine is the main site of nutrient absorption, the stomach can absorb some substances, such as water, alcohol, and certain drugs like aspirin.<br>
<br>
<b>

​4. Regulation:</b>
<br>

The stomach's activity is tightly regulated by both the nervous system and hormones. <br>
<br>
When you smell, see, or even think about food, your brain sends signals that tell the stomach to start preparing for digestion. <br>
<br>
Hormones like gastrin also play a crucial role in stimulating the secretion of gastric acid.<br>
 <b>

​5. Common Conditions:</b>
<br>
<br><b></p>

<p>


​Acid Reflux/GERD:</b>
<br>
 Occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation.<br>
<br><b>
</p>

<p>

​Gastritis:</b>
 Inflammation of the stomach lining.<br>
<br><b>


​Peptic Ulcers:</b>
 <br>
<br>
Sores that form on the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or small intestine, often caused by the bacterium H. pylori or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<br>
<br>

​The stomach's ability to safely and efficiently break down food is a fascinating example of the body's complex and highly specialized biological systems.</p></p>

</h3>
 <br>
<br>
         <img src="lym.jpg" height="350px" width="300px"><br>
<br>

<p>

This is part of the vascular system.<br>
<br>
 It forms the second type of circulation. <br>
<br>         <img src="lym1.jpg" height="380px" width="300px">
 <br>

Most of 
the tissue fluid as explained above goes back into the blood capillaries and the 
remainder enters the lymphatic system and becomes lymph fluid.<br>
<br>
 The lymph fluid 
is transported through lymph vessels.<br>
<br>
 The lymph vessels are similar to veins but 
they have more valves than the veins. <br>
<br>
The movement of the lymph fluid through 
the lymph vessels is due to the contractions of the surrounding muscles.<br>
<br>
 As they 
contract and relax, they squeeze the lymph vessels to gain the force by which 
lymph moves.<br>
<br>
 The walls of the lymphatic vessels have pores, which allow the 
entry of cell, wastes and bacteria. Before reaching the blood, lymph passes through 
the lymph nodes where the wastes and bacteria are removed. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>

The lymph joins the blood circulation via the thoracic ducts, which join the vein in 
the neck.<br>
<br>
 The right thoracic duct drains its contents of the right side and that ofleft drains the left side.<br>
<br>
 The lacteals of the ileum are also connected to the left 
thoracic duct. <br>
<br>
<b>

 
Functions of the lymphatic system </b>
<br>
<br>

1. It transports fatty acids and glycerol from the ileum to the heart where they join 
the blood system. <br>
<br>
<p>

2. It carries excretory substances from tissues to the blood stream.<br>
<br>
 
3. It produces white blood cells, which assist in defense of the body. <br>
<br>

4. It filters out bacteria before they reach the blood stream. <br>
<br>

5. Transports hormones from glands to other body parts. <br>

<h3 id="digestive">THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</h3>
 <br>
<p><img src="digestive1.jpg"
width="100%" height="350px">
<br><p><img src="digestive.jpg"
width="100%" height="350px">
<br>
 The digestive system, a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus, processes the food you eat. <br>
<br><p>

Its main function is to break down food into smaller molecules that the body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and cellular repair. <br>
<br><p>

It also removes waste products from the body. <br>
<br>
 <b>
<p>

​Parts of the Digestive System</b>
<br>
<br>

​The digestive system is composed of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is the main pathway for food, and several accessory organs. <br>
<br>
<b>
 
​The GI Tract</b>
<b>
<br>
<br>

​Mouth: </b>
Digestion begins here.<br>
<br>
 Chewing breaks down food mechanically, while salivary amylase, an enzyme in saliva, starts the chemical digestion of carbohydrates.  <br>
<br>
<b><p>

Pharynx & Esophagus:</b>
<br>The pharynx (throat) is the passageway for food.<br>
<br>
 The esophagus is a muscular tube that uses waves of muscle contractions called peristalsis to push food from the pharynx down to the stomach.  <br>
<br><p>

<b>

​Stomach: </b>
A J-shaped organ that stores food and mixes it with gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin. <br>
<br>
This mix, called<b>
 chyme, </b>
is then slowly released into the small intestine. <br>
<br>Most of the digestion in the stomach is chemical.<br>
<br>
 Food is allowed into the stomach 
from the oesophagus by a ring of muscle called the Cardiac Sphincter. <br>
<br>

In the stomach, there is only protein digestion. <br>
<br>

Gastric juice is secreted and it contains two enzymes, (pepsin and renin), 
hydrochloric acid, mucus and water. <br>
<br>

Pepsin acts upon proteins/ breaking them down into polypeptides. <br>
<br>

Pepsin is initially secreted in an inactive form called Pepsinogen which is activated 
into active pepsin by hydrochloric acid.<br>
<br>
 This is the safe guard mechanism because 
if pepsin was stored in its active form, it would destroy the gut walls or stomach 
walls since they are protein in nature (self-digestion). <br>
<br>

Pepsin works at low PH i.e. acidic conditions provided by the presence of 
Hydrochloric acid (HCl).<br>
<br>
 
Renin coagulates milk.<br>
<br>
 (Makes it insoluble) i.e. it converts the soluble milk protein 
caseinogen to an insoluble curd, casein which is then acted upon by pepsin 
breaking it down to polypeptide. <br>
<br>
<p>

Rennin is an important enzyme especially in young mammals since they feed on milky<br>
<img src="put.jpg" height="100px" width="300px">
 <b><br>


​Small Intestine: </b>
This is where most digestion and nutrient absorption occur.<br>
<br>
 It's divided into three parts:<br><b>

 the Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.</b>
 The small intestine receives digestive juices from the pancreas and bile from the liver.<br><u>
<b><br>Duodenum<br>
</b></u><p>

The chime from the stomach enters the duodenum in small quantities at a time 
regulated by the pyloric sphincter.<br>
<br>
 There are access organs which provide 
secretions.<br>
<br>
 They secret bile from the gall bladder and pancreatic juice from the 
pancrease 
The arrival of food in the duodenum stimulates the production of a hormone called 
secretin from the pancrease and another hormone called cholecystokinin which 
stimulates secretion of bile from the gall bladder. <br>
<br><p>

The secretions are alkaline thus 
stopping the action of pepsin and provides an ideal medium for enzymes in 
pancreatic juice to work.<br>
<br>
 Pancreatic juice contains a number of enzymes which are 
called the <b>
 pancreatic enzymes.</b>

  <br>
  <img src="table4.jpg" height="120px" width="350px">Trypsin is also secreted in an inactive form, trypsinogen to prevent it from 
digesting the duodenum walls. <br>
<br>

Both trypsin and pancreatic amylase act upon proteins and starch that were not 
broken down in the stomach and mouth respectively. <br><br><u>
<b><br>Ileum<br>
</b></u>
This is where final digestion takes place. <br>
<br>

Food moves down from the duodenum into the ileum by peristalsis. <br>
<br>
<p>

The presence of food in the ileum stimulates the secretion of the intestinal juice, 
succus entericus by walls of the ileum. <br>
<br>

Succus entericus contains several enzymes which complete the process of 
digestion forming a milky fluid substance called chyle (food after final digestion is 
called chyle). 
<br>

​Large Intestine:</b>
 This includes the colon and rectum.<br>
<br>
 Its primary function is to absorb water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and to store feces before it is eliminated.  <br>
<br>
<b>
<p>

​Anus:</b>
 The external opening at the end of the digestive tract through which solid waste is eliminatedAccessory Organs<br>
<br>

​These organs are crucial for digestion but are not part of the GI tract itself. <br>
<br>
 <b>

​Liver:</b>
 Produces bile, a substance that helps digest fats.  <br>
<br>
<b>

​Gallbladder:</b>
 Stores and concentrates bile from the liver and releases it into the small intestine. <br>
<br>
<b>
 <p>

​Pancreas:</b>
 Produces pancreatic juices containing enzymes (like amylase, lipase, and protease) that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.<br>
<br>
</b>
 It also produces insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate blood sugar<br>
<br>
<b>
.​Mechanical vs. Chemical Digestion</b>
<br>
<b>

​Mechanical Digestion:</b>
 This is the physical breakdown of food into smaller pieces.<br>
<br>
 It starts in the mouth with chewing and continues in the stomach with its churning and mixing actions.<br>
<br>
 Mechanical digestion increases the surface area of food, making it easier for enzymes to act on it.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Chemical Digestion:</b>
 This is the breakdown of food molecules into simpler nutrients using enzymes.<br>
<br>
 It begins in the mouth with salivary amylase, but most of it happens in the stomach and small intestine.<br>
<br>
<b><p>

 For example,</b>
 pepsin in the stomach breaks down proteins, while pancreatic lipase in the small intestine breaks down fats.<br>
<br>
<b>

​The Role of Enzymes</b>

​Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions.<br>
<br><p>

 Different enzymes are specialized to break down different types of food.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Amylase:</b>
 Breaks down carbohydrates (starches and sugars). It's found in saliva and pancreatic juice.<br>
<br>
<b><p>


​Protease:</b>
 Breaks down proteins. <br>
<br>
Examples include pepsin in the stomach and trypsin in the small intestine.<b>
<br>
<br>

​Lipase:</b>
 Breaks down fats (lipids). Pancreatic lipase is the main enzyme for fat digestion.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Hormonal and Neural Regulation</b>
<br>
<br>

​The digestive system isn't just a simple tube; it's a highly regulated process.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Hormones:</b>
 Key hormones like gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) control various functions<br>
<br><p>

. Gastrin stimulates the stomach to produce acid, while secretin tells the pancreas to release bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine.<br>
<br>
 CCK stimulates the gallbladder to release bile and the pancreas to release enzymes.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Nerves:</b>
 The enteric nervous system, often called the "second brain," is a mesh of nerves that lines the GI tract.<br>
<br>
 It controls peristalsis and the release of digestive juices.<br>
<br><p>

 The brain and spinal cord also play a role, for example, the sight or smell of food can trigger the salivary glands to start working.<br>
<br>

<h3 id="1.1">interesting Science Facts  1.1</h3>

The small intestine is about 22 feet (6.7 meters) long in an adult, which is why it's so efficient at absorbing nutrients.<br>
<br><p>

The surface area of the small intestine is roughly the size of a tennis court, thanks to its tiny finger-like projections called villi and even smaller microvilli. <br>
<br>
This immense surface area is key to its absorption function.<br>
<br>
The human gut is home to trillions of bacteria, known as the gut microbiome.<br>
<br>
 These microorganisms are essential for breaking down certain fibers and producing vitamins like K and someAfter all the nutrients have been absorbed in the small intestine, the digestive process concludes with the large intestine and the elimination of waste.<br>
<br>

​The large intestine receives the leftover, undigestible food matter and plays a final, crucial role.<br>
<br>
 Its primary job is to absorb water and electrolytes, which converts the liquid waste into a solid mass known as feces. <br>
<br>
This process is essential for maintaining the body's fluid balance.<br>
<br>

​The large intestine is also home to trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiome. <br>
<br>

This diverse community of bacteria is vital for our health.<br>
<br>
 They break down complex carbohydrates that our own enzymes can't digest and produce important vitamins, such as <b>
vitamin K and some B</b>
 vitamins.<br>
<br><p>

  A healthy gut microbiome is increasingly recognized by science for its role in not only digestion but also immune function and even mental health.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the digestive system is a sophisticated and highly efficient process that not only provides the body with the energy and building blocks it needs but also works in harmony with a vast internal ecosystem to maintain overall health.

<h3 id="resp">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
<br><p>

<br>
 The respiratory system is a fascinating and vital biological system that takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide.<br>
<br>
 It is a complex network of organs and tissues that works together to allow us to breathe.  <b>
<br>
<br>
<p>

​Key Components
<br>
<br>

</b>

<u>
<b>
 Upper Respiratory Tract<br>
<br></b></u>



​The upper respiratory tract includes the parts that are outside the chest cavity.<br>
<br><p>
<p>

 It is responsible for filtering, warming, and humidifying the air we breathe.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Nose and Nasal Cavity:</b>
<br>
 The primary entry point for air. The nasal cavity is lined with hair and mucus to trap dust, pollen, and other particles. It also warms and moistens the air before it reaches the lungs.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Pharynx (Throat):</b>
<br>
 A shared pathway for both food and air. It's divided into three parts: <br>
the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.<br>
<br>
<b><p>


​Larynx (Voice Box):</b>
<br>
 Located at the top of the trachea.<br>
<br>
 It contains the vocal cords, which produce sound, and the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage that closes to prevent food from entering the trachea when you swallow.<br>
<br>
<b>
<u>

​Lower Respiratory Tract</b>
<br></u>

<br>

​The lower respiratory tract consists of the organs within the chest cavity, where gas exchange occurs.<br>
<br>

​Trachea (Windpipe):</b>
<br>
 A tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi.<br>
<br><p>

 Its walls are supported by rings of cartilage to keep the airway open.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Bronchi and Bronchioles:</b>
<br>
 The trachea branches into two main bronchi, one leading to each lung.<br>
<br>
 These tubes divide into smaller and smaller branches called bronchioles, which deliver air to the tiny air sacs.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Lungs:</b>
<br><p>

 The main organs of the respiratory system. The right lung has three lobes, while the left lung has two, leaving space for the heart.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Alveoli:</b>
<br>
 These are tiny, balloon-like air sacs at the ends of the bronchioles.<br>
<br>
 The walls of the alveoli are very thin and are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. This is where gas exchange takes place: <br>
oxygen diffuses from the <b>
alveol</b>
i into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.<br><b>

<br>​Structure and Function
<br></b>
<br>
<br>
<br><p>


<br>
​The alveoli are located at the end of the bronchioles, the smallest branches of the respiratory tree.<br>
<br>
 There are hundreds of millions of them in the human lungs, giving the lungs a huge surface area for gas exchange. <br>
<br>
The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin, allowing gases to pass through easily. They are surrounded by a dense network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.
<b>

​Diaphragm:</b>
<br>
 A large, dome-shaped muscle located below the lungs. <br>
<br>
It is the main muscle of respiration. When you inhale, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, increasing the volume of the chest cavity and pulling air into the lungs.<br><p>

<br>
 When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes, and the chest cavity decreases in size, pushing air out.<br>

​The Breathing Process<br>

​Breathing, or respiration, is a two-step process: <b>
 
​Inhalation (Inspiration): </b>
<br>
The diaphragm contracts, and the intercostal muscles between the ribs also contract, causing the chest cavity to expand.<br>
<br>
 This creates a vacuum, pulling air into the lungs. <br>
<b><p>

 
​Exhalation (Expiration): </b>
<br>
<br>
The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, reducing the size of the chest cavity.<br>
<br>
 This pushes air out of the lungs, expelling carbon dioxide.<b><br>


​How it Works with Other Systems<br></b>


​The respiratory system doesn't work in isolation. It is closely connected to other body systems, especially the circulatory system.<br>
<br>
 The circulatory system acts as the body's transport network. It picks up oxygen from the lungs and delivers it to every cell in the body. <br>
<br>
At the same time, it picks up carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, from the cells and transports it back to the lungs to be exhaled.  <b><br>
<br><p>


<center style="font-size:18pt;">
​Common Respiratory Conditions</center></b>

​Some common conditions affecting the respiratory system include:<br>
<br>
<b>

​Asthma:</b>
<br>
 A chronic condition where the airways become inflamed and narrowed, making breathing difficult.  </b>
<br><br><b>
Bronchitis</b>
<br>
<p>

​This is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the airways that carry air to and from your lungs.
​<br>
<br>
<b>
Acute bronchitis<br>
</b>
 is a short-term condition often caused by a viral infection, like a cold or the flu. It usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Chronic bronchitis </b>
<br>
is a long-term, more serious condition characterized by a persistent, productive cough that lasts for at least three months and recurs for at least two consecutive years. <br>
<br>
It is a major component of COPD and is often linked to smoking.<br>
<br>

​Symptoms include a persistent cough that may produce mucus, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest discomfort.<b>
<br>
<br>

​Emphysema<br>
</b>

​This is a type of COPD that involves damage to the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli).<br>
<br>

​The walls of the alveoli are destroyed, leading to larger, less efficient air sacs.<br>
<br>

​This damage reduces the total surface area available for gas exchange, making it harder for the body to get the oxygen it needs.
​Symptoms include shortness of breath, a chronic cough, and fatigue. <br>
<br>
The most common cause is long-term exposure to airborne irritants, such as cigarette smoke.<b>
<br>
<br>

​Lung Cancer</b>
<br>

​This is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lungs. <br>
<br>
It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
​Causes are primarily linked to smoking, though other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, and occupational hazards.<br>
<br>

​Symptoms may not appear in the early stages, but can include a persistent cough that worsens over time, chest pain, weight loss, and coughing up blood.<b>
<br>
<br>

​Tuberculosis (TB)<br>

</b>

​This is a serious bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs.<br>
<br>

​TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br>
<br>

​While treatable with antibiotics, it can be fatal if not properly managed.<br>
<br>

​Symptoms include a chronic cough, chest pain, fever, weight loss, and night sweats.<br>
<br>

​The <b>
Common Cold and Flu</b>
<br>

​These are common viral infections of the upper respiratory tract.<br>
<br><p>


​The common cold is a mild viral infection of the nose and throat, with symptoms like a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat.<br>
<br>
<b><p>


​The flu (influenza) </b>
is a more severe viral infection that can cause fever, body aches, and fatigue in addition to respiratory symptoms.<br>
<br>

​While usually not life-threatening, these infections can sometimes lead to more serious conditions like pneumonia, especially in vulnerable populations.
<b>
<p>


​Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</b>
<br>
 A group of progressive lung diseases that block airflow and make it difficult to breathe.<b>
<br><br>
<p>


​Pneumonia:</b><br>

 An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus.

<h3 id="1.2">Interesting facts 1.2</h3>

The Air We Breathe
​An average adult breathes about 16 times per minute and inhales approximately 11,000 liters of air per day.<p>

​We can't survive for more than a few minutes without breathing.<br>
<br>
 The longest a human has ever voluntarily held their breath is over 24 minutes!
​Unique Lung Facts
​Your lungs are not the same size.<br><p>

<br>
 The left lung is smaller than the right lung to make room for your heart.  
​The total surface area of all the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs is about the size of a tennis court, roughly 70 square meters.<br>
<br>
 This massive surface area is crucial for efficient gas exchange.
​Your lungs are the only organs that can float on water.<br><p>

<br>
 This is because they contain tiny air-filled sacs. <br>
<br>
 
​The Breathing Process
​The diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle under your lungs, does most of the work of breathing. When it contracts, it flattens and pulls air into the lungs. <br>
<br>
 <p>

​You don't just breathe out carbon dioxide. <br>
<br>
When you exhale, you also release water vapor.<br>
<br>
 This is why you can see your breath on a cold day.  <br>
<br>

​A cough is a forceful expulsion of air that can travel at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).<br>
<br>
 A sneeze is even faster, reaching speeds of up to 100 mph as well.<br>
<b>
<p>

​Other Interesting Facts</b>
<br>
<br>

​The hairs in your nose, called cilia, are a first line of defense, trapping dust and germs before they can enter your lungs. <br>
<br>
The mucus in your nose also helps with this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>

​Your respiratory rate is highest when you are at rest, and it increases with exercise, stress, and when you are at high altitudes to compensate for the lower oxygen levels in the air.<br>

<h3 id="reproductive">THE REPRODUCTION SYSTEM</h3>


The reproductive system is a fascinating and crucial biological system for the continuation of a species. <br>
<br>
Its primary function is to enable the production of offspring.<p>
<br>
<br>
 This involves the creation of sex cells, or gametes, and their combination to form a new organism.<br>
<br>
<p>
 The male and female reproductive systems are distinct in structure and function.<br>
<br>
<h3>

​Key Functions of the Reproductive System:</h3>
<br>
<br>
 
<b>

​Production of Gametes:</b>
<p>
 <br>
The male system produces sperm cells, and the female system produces egg cells (ova).<br>
<br>
<p>
 These gametes carry the genetic information from each parent.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Production of Hormones:</b>
<br>
<p>
 The reproductive organs also produce sex hormones (like testosterone in males and estrogen and progesterone in females) that regulate sexual development, physical characteristics, and the reproductive cycle.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Sexual Function:</b>
<br>
<p>
 The system includes organs that enable sexual intercourse, which is the mechanism for transferring sperm from the male to the female.<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>

​Gestation and Birth:</b>
<br>
<p>
 In females, the reproductive system provides the environment to nourish and protect a fertilized egg as it develops into a fetus, and ultimately, to give birth.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="male">

The Male Reproductive System</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>

​The male system is designed to produce and deliver sperm. <br>
<br><h3>

Its main organs are external:</h3>
 <br>
<br>
<p>
<b>

​Testes (Testicles):</b>
<br><p>

 The primary reproductive organs.<br>
<br>
 They produce sperm and the male sex hormone, testosterone.<br>
<br><p>

 They are located in the scrotum, a sac outside the body that keeps them at the optimal temperature for sperm production.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Penis:</b>
<br>
<p>
 The external organ used for urination and sexual intercourse.<br>
<br>
 It contains the urethra, a tube that carries both urine and semen.<br>
<br>
<b>

​Scrotum:</b>
<br>
 A sac of skin that holds the testes.<br><br>

<b>

​Ducts and Glands:</b>
<br><p>

 A network of tubes (like the epididymis and vas deferens) and glands (including the prostate and seminal vesicles) work together to mature sperm, produce the fluid that nourishes them (semen), and transport them during ejaculation.<br>
<br>
<h3 id="female">

<br><p>
<h3>

Most of its organs are internal:</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>

​Ovaries: The female gonads. They produce eggs (ova) and the female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone.<br>
<br>

​Fallopian Tubes: These tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus.<br>
<br>
<p>
 They are the usual site of fertilization, where sperm and egg meet.
​Uterus (Womb): A hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ where a fertilized egg can implant and grow into a fetus.<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>

​Cervix:</b>
<br>
 The lower, narrow part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It helps protect the uterus from infection.<br>
<br><b>


​Vagina:</b>
<br>
 A muscular canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. It serves as the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and as the birth canal during childbirth.<br>
<br><p>

<b>

​Vulva:</b>
 The external female genitalia, which includes the labia and clitoris.

<p>
<h3>

The Male Reproductive System:</h3>
 Detailed Parts and Functions
​The male reproductive system is composed of both external and internal organs.<br>
<br>
<p>
  <h3>

​External Parts:</h3>
<br>
 <br>
<b>

​Penis:</b>
<br>
 This is the male organ used for urination and sexual intercourse.<br>
<br>
 It contains spongy tissue that can fill with blood, causing an erection, which is necessary for intercourse. <br>
<br>
<p>
The urethra, a tube that carries both urine and semen, runs through the penis.  <br>
<br>
<b>

​Scrotum:</b>
<br>
<p>
 This is a loose pouch of skin that hangs behind the penis. <br>
<br><p>

Its primary function is to hold and protect the testes. <br>
<br><p>

The scrotum acts as a temperature regulator, keeping the testes at a slightly cooler temperature than the rest of the body, which is essential for healthy sperm production.<br>
<br>
<b>
  
​Testes (Testicles):</b>
<p>
<br>
 These are a pair of egg-shaped glands located within the scrotum.<b>
 They have two main functions:</b>
<br>
<br>
  <b>

​Sperm production:</b>
<br>
<p>
 The testes produce millions of sperm cells in tiny, coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. <b>
<br>
<br>
 
​Hormone production: </b>
<p>
<br>
They produce testosterone, the main male sex hormone, which is responsible for male secondary sexual characteristics and sperm development.  <br>

​<br>
<b>
Internal Parts:<br>
</b>
<p>

​Epididymis: This is a highly coiled tube located on the back of each testis.<br>
<br>
<p>
 Sperm produced in the testes mature here, gaining the ability to "swim" and fertilize an egg.<br>
<br>
<b>
  
​Vas Deferens:</b>
<br>
<p>
 A thick-walled tube that transports mature sperm from the epididymis up to the urethra. <br>
<b>
 
​Seminal Vesicles: <br>
</b>

<p>
These are two small glands located above the prostate gland.<br>
<br>
<p>
 They produce a fluid that makes up a large portion of semen. <p>
<br>
<br>
This fluid contains fructose, which provides energy for the sperm, as well as other substances that help with sperm mobility.<br>
<br>
  <b>

​Prostate Gland:<br>
</b><p>

 This walnut-sized gland sits below the bladder and surrounds the urethra.<br>
<br>
 It secretes a milky, alkaline fluid that is also part of semen. This fluid helps to protect the sperm from the acidic environment of the vagina.  <b>
<br>
<br>

​Urethra: <p>
</b>
<br>
This tube runs from the bladder through the penis to the outside of the body. In males, it serves as the pathway for both urine and semen.

<h3>

​The Female Reproductive System:</h3>
<br><p>

 Detailed Parts and Functions<br>
<br>
<p>

​The female reproductive system is primarily internal and is designed for the production of eggs, fertilization, and supporting a pregnancy.<br>
<br>
  
<h3>Internal Parts:</h3><b>
<br>
<br>

​Ovaries:</b>
 <p>
<br>
These are the female gonads, two small, oval-shaped glands located on either side of the uterus. <br>
<br>
<p>
They contain all the eggs a female will ever have from birth.<b>
<br>
 Ovaries have two main functions:</b>
  <br>
<br>

​Egg (ovum) production: </b>
<p>
<br>
An egg is released from one of the ovaries each month during ovulation.<b>
<br>
<br>

​Hormone production: <p>
</b>
<br>
They produce the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and are crucial for pregnancy.<b>
<br>
<br>
  
​Fallopian Tubes:</b>
 <br><p>

These are narrow tubes that extend from the ovaries to the uterus.<br>
<br>
<p>
 They are where fertilization usually occurs.<br>
<br>
<p>
 After an egg is released from the ovary, it travels down the fallopian tube to meet a sperm. <br>
<br>
<b>
 
​Uterus (Womb):</b>
<br>
 This is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ.<br>
<br><p>

 Its main role is to house and nourish a developing fetus during pregnancy.<br>
<br>
 The inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, thickens each month in preparation for a fertilized egg.<b>
<br>
<br>
  <p>

​Cervix:<br>
</b>
 The lower, narrow part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.<br>
<br>
 It acts as a gateway, allowing menstrual blood to exit and sperm to enter the uterus.<br>
<br>
 During childbirth, the cervix dilates to allow the baby to pass through.<b>
  <br>
<br><p>


​Vagina: </b><br>

This is a muscular canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body.<br>
<br>
<b>
 It serves three main functions:</b>
 it receives the penis during sexual intercourse, it is the pathway for menstrual blood to exit the body, and it serves as the birth canal.<br>
<br><p>

  <h3>
​External Parts (The Vulva):</h3><b>

​Labia Majora and Minora:</b>
 <br>
These are folds of skin that protect the sensitive external parts of the genitalia.  <br>
<br>
<b>
</b><p>


​Clitoris:</b><br>

 A small, sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva that is a center for sexual pleasure.<b>
  <br>
<br>

​Bartholin's Glands:</b><br>
<p>

 Located on either side of the vaginal opening, these glands produce a lubricating fluid. <br>

THE KIDNEY </h3>
<br>
<br>

 
<b>
Structure of the kidney </b>
<br>
<br><p>

The kidneys are solid bean-shaped structures and they occur in pairs in 
mammals. <br>
<br><p>

They are reddish-brown in colour enclosed in a transparent 
membrane and attached to the back of the abdominal cavity. <br>
<br>
<p>

The kidney tissue consists of many capillaries and renal tubules connected 
together by connective tissue. The kidney has two major parts. <br>
<br>

<b>
1. The cortex</b>
 which is a dark outer part. It consists of the Bowman’s capsule 
which is responsible for ultra-filtration of blood passing across it. <br>
<br>

<b>
2. The medulla,</b>
 which is a lighter inner, part. It is made up of many cone shaped portions called pyramids. <br>
<br>

The pelvis is the area where the ureter leaves the kidney. <br>
<br>

 
The kidney performs three major functions in the body. <br>
<br><p>


1. It carries out excretion. <br>
<br>

2. It carries out the function of osmoregulation. <br>
<br>
<p>

3. It contains endocrine glands, which secreteThe kidney is made up of several microscopic structures (functional units) 
called nephrons where the actual excretion and osmoregulation takes place. <br>
<br>

<h3 id="nep">THE NEPHRONE </h3>
<p>

This is the functional unit of the kidney.<br>
<br>
<p>
 It carries out the function of excretion 
and osmoregulation in the kidney. <p>
<br>
<br>

The nephron consists of a cup-shaped structure known as the bowmans’ 
capsule.<br>
<br>
<p>
 Blood comes to the nephrone through the afferent vessel, which is a 
branch of the renal artery, and it leaves through the efferent vessel. <br>
<br>
<p>

The efferent vessel joins many other efferent vessels from other nephrones to 
form the renal vein. <p>
<br>
<br><p>


In the bowmans’ capsule the afferent vessel divides to form capillaries. <br>
<br>
<p>

The capillaries are highly coiled and they form a knot called glomerulus. <br>
<br>
<p>

Leading from the bowman’s’ capsule is a highly coiled tube known as proximal 
convoluted tubule.<br>
<br>
 This is continuous with a U shaped tubule called loop on 
Henle. <br>
<br>
<p>

The loop is divided into the descending loop and ascending loop. <br>
<br>
<p>

From the loop of Henle the tube becomes highly coiled to form the distal 
convoluted tubule which leads to the collecting duct. <br>
<br>
<h3><p>

Structure of the nephron Parts of nephron </h3>
 <br>
<br>
<b>
<p>

1. Bowman’s capsule: </b>
<br>

It contains a dense-network of capillaries called glomerulus. <br>
<br><p>

The glomerulus is 
formed from the wider arteriole of renal artery called <b>
afferent arteriole.</b>
 It is 
located in the cortex. <br>
<br>
<p>

The Bowman’s capsule serves the function of filtering small molecules in blood 
such as urea glucose, etc. through a process called <b><p>

ultra-filtration.</b>
<br>
<br>
 
 
Adaptations of the glomerulus to ultra-filtration <br>
<br>
<p>

i) Having high blood pressure that forces small molecules out of the 
glomerulus. <br>
<br>
This is due to the afferent arteriole being wider than the efferent. <br>
<br><p>


ii) Having many capillaries that give it a large surface area for ultra-filtration. <br>
<br><p>


iii) Having a semi permeable membrane that can allow any small molecule to 
pass through. <br>
<br><p>


Adaptations of the Bowman’s capsule to collect the filtrate <br>
<br>
<p>

i) Possession of cup-shaped structure which enables it to collect the filtrate. <br>
<br>

ii) Having a porous upper membrane that easily allows filtration. <br>
<br>

iii) Having a large volume that can accommodate more filtrate.

This is a site where re-absorption of useful materials such as glucose and some 
small amino acids and water from glomerular filtrate back to blood takes place. 
 <br>
<br>
<b>

3. Loop of Henle: </b>
<br>
<p>

It’s made up of a descending (going down) limb and an ascending (going up) 
limb.<br>
<br><p>

 The main function of the loop of Henle is to make the tissue fluid in the 
medulla more concentrated than the glomerular filtrate in the nephron so that 
water needed in the body is reabsorbed.<br>
<br><p>

 It’s known to cause the retention of 
water.<br>
<br>
 This is one way of conserving water in camel because of its extremely 
long loop of Henle. <p>

 <br>
<br>

<b>
4. Distal convoluted tubule: </b>
<br>
<p>

It chiefly re-absorbs salts like chloride ions together with water, leaving a 
concentrated liquid now called urine which passes down to collecting ducts.<br>
<br>
<p>

 
<b>
5. Collecting duct: </b>
<br>
This duct carries urine from the distal tubule to the pelvis of kidney. <br>
<br><p>

It allows 
outward movement of water thus conserving it. <br>
<br>
<b>

 
Adaptations of the nephron to re absorption </b>
<br>
<p>

i) Having a thin membrane (one cell thick) for easy diffusion of materials. <br>
<br>

ii) Having micro villi to increase the surface area for re absorption. <br>
<br>

iii) Having numerous mitochondria to provide energy for active reabsorption. 
 <br>
<br>
<h3>
URINE FORMATION </h3>
 <p>

The process of urine formation takes place in the nephrone. <br>
<br>
It occurs in two 
phases. <br>
<br>
 <p>
<b>

1. Ultra-filtration. </b>
<br>
<br>

2. Selective re-absorption.<br>
 
Ultra filtration 
Much blood comes from the afferent vessel into the glomerulus than that 
which leaves through efferent because the afferent vessel is larger than the 
efferent vessel. <br>
<br><p>


This generates pressure in the blood capillaries of the glomerulus forcing 
small molecules to filter out of the blood capillaries to form the glomerular 
filtrate. <br>
<br>
<p>

Blood in the renal artery contains proteins, red blood cells, white blood cells, 
urea, water, salts, amino acids and vitamins. <br>
<br>
<p>

In the glomerulus, small molecules filter out by ultra filtration to form the 
glomerular filtrate.<br>
<br><p>

 This filtrate contains glucose, urea, water, salts and 
vitamins.<br>
<br>
 <p>

Proteins and blood cells do not filter out because they have bigger 
molecules, which cannot pass through the walls of the glomerulus. <br>
<br>
<p>

 The filtrate formed moves from the Bowman’s capsule through the capsular 
space to <b>
proximal convoluted tubul</b><p>where selective reabsorption starts to 
occur.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<h3 id="plantex">
EXCRETION IN PLANTS </h3>
<br>
<p>


Plants excrete less poisonous waste products like CO2 through the stomata and 
acids through dropping leaves and fruits. <br>
<br><p>

Plants do not require specialized 
excretory organs due to;<br>
 
i) Plants can store excess proteins unlike in mammals. <br>
<br>
<p>

ii) They accumulate less metabolic wastes due to their low metabolic rate. 
<br>
<br>
iii) Plants synthesize their organic food substances according to their 
requirements.<br>
<br>
 This ensures that no excess is made.<br>
<br>
 <p>

iv) Plants do not produce nitrogenous waste products.<br><p>

<br>
 They produce non-nitrogenous wastes, which are less toxic to their bodies.<br>
<br><p>

 
v) Some wastes accumulate in particular parts of the plant and they are 
eliminated when this part of the plant falls off.<br>
<br><p>

 
vi) Some of the wastes are useful in other processes within the plants body.<br>
<br>
 For 
example Carbon dioxide produced from respiration can be used in 
photosynthesis. <br>
<br><p>


vii) They do not locomote and they are less metabolically active than animals.

<h3 id="homeo">
HOMEOSTASIS</h3><br>
<p>
This is the maintenance of a constant internal environment of the body <br>
<br>
The 
internal environment of the body is composed of tissue fluids, which surround 
cells.<br>
<br><p>

<b>
 Homeostasis </b>
involves controlling the blood sugar level, salt level, water 
level, temperature and Carbon dioxide concentration. <br>
<p>
<h3>
 How Homeostasis Works</h3>
<br>
<br><p>


​The body maintains homeostasis through feedback loops, which are a series of events that respond to a stimulus.<br>
<br>
 There are three key components to a homeostatic control system:  <br>
<br><p>


​Receptor (Sensor):</b>
<br>
 This component detects a change in the internal environment (the stimulus). <br>
<br><p>

For example, temperature receptors in your skin and brain detect when your body temperature starts to rise.<br>
<br>
<b>
  
​Control Center:</b>
<br>
 This receives information from the receptor, processes it, and compares it to a set point (the ideal value).<br>
<br><p>

 The hypothalamus in the brain is a major control center for many homeostatic processes.<b>
<br>
<br>
  
​Effector: <br>
</b>
This is an organ or gland that receives a signal from the control center and carries out a response to correct the change.<br>
<br><p>

 For example, sweat glands would be an effector to cool the body down.  Examples:<br>
<b><p>


​Childbirth:</b>
<br>
 The pressure of a baby's head against the cervix stimulates the release of the hormone oxytocin. <br><p>

<br>
Oxytocin causes stronger uterine contractions, which in turn increase the pressure on the cervix, leading to the release of more oxytocin. <br>
<br><p>

This cycle continues to intensify until the baby is born, at which point the stimulus (pressure) is removed and the loop ends. <b>
<br>
<br><p>

 
​Blood Clotting:<br>
</b><p>

 When a blood vessel is injured, platelets are activated. These activated platelets release chemicals that attract more platelets, and the process rapidly escalates to form a clot that stops the bleeding
 <br>
<br>

CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 
The continual circulation of blood in mammals is due to the pumping action of the 
heart. 
The circulation of blood in mammals is divided into two. That is; 1. The pulmonary circulation; this is the circulation of blood from the heart to 
the lungs and from the lungs back to the heart. It is the simplest circulation 
where blood moves a very short distance. This type of circulation involves the 
pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. 
2. The systemic circulation; this is the circulation of blood from the heart to the 
rest of the body apart from the lungs and from the rest of the body back to the 
heart.

<p>
These are the tubes that carry blood throughout the body and they include: arteries,        <br>

veins, and capillaries
Arteries and veins both have three layers in their walls but the layer of the muscles 
(elastic tissue).is much greater in arteries than in the veins. </p>      <br>

<p>
These are the smallest blood vessels with thin walls to allow diffusion of materials 
between blood and the tissue fluid.       <br>

They connect arterioles to venules.       <br>

They pass very close to the cells taking to the cells food, oxygen, and mineral salts 
etc as well as taking a way carbon dioxide, urea and other waste products from the 
cells.    <br>

 They are responsible for the exchange of materials between blood and cells, 
because their walls are permeable allowing water, dissolved food substances to 
pass through except proteins because they have large molecules.       <br>
       <br>

Blood pressure reduces in them as a result of their resistance, and blood flows in 
them slowly without pulse.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

The capillaries network is so dense and the capillaries unite to form large vessels 
called venules which join to form veins.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

Adaptations of capillaries to its functions
 They have a large surface area for exchange of materials.       <br>
       <br>
<p>

They have very thin walls for faster diffusion of materials.       <br>
       <br>

 They have a high diffusion gradient leading to rapid diffusion of materials.
Slow movement of blood in capillaries makes exchange of materials efficient.       <br>

<p><b>The circulatory system</b>, also known as the cardiovascular system, is the body's transportation network. It's a complex system of organs and vessels that moves blood, nutrients, hormones, and oxygen to and from cells throughout the body.</p>
​<h3>Components of the System</h3>
<br>
<p>The main components are:</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Heart</b></p>
<p>This is the central pump of the system. The heart is a muscular organ that contracts and relaxes to pump blood throughout the body. It has four chambers: the right atrium, the right ventricle, the left atrium, and the left ventricle.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Blood Vessels</b></p>
<p>Blood vessels are the tubes that carry blood. There are three main types:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Arteries:</b> These carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. The main artery is the aorta.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Veins:</b> These carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Capillaries:</b> These are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins. They are where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products happens at the cellular level.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Blood</b></p>
<p>Blood is the fluid that flows through the system. It consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen with the help of a protein called hemoglobin.</p>

 <h2 id="urine">The Urinary System</h2>
  <img src="urine.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

<p><b>The urinary system</b> is a vital biological system that helps the body maintain a stable internal environment. Its primary function is to filter blood and create urine as a waste product. It's also known as the renal system.</p>
​<br>
<h3 id="urine1">Components of the System</h3>
  <img src="urine1.jpg" height="350px" width="450px">

<br>
<p>The main organs of the urinary system are:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Kidneys</b></p>
<p>The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine. Their main job is to filter blood, removing excess water, salts, and waste products to produce urine. The kidneys also play a key role in regulating blood pressure and red blood cell production.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Ureters</b></p>
<p>The ureters are two thin tubes that transport urine from the kidneys down to the bladder. They use muscular contractions to move the urine along.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Bladder</b></p>
<p>The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine. It can expand significantly to hold a large amount of urine until it is time to urinate.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Urethra</b></p>
<p>The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body during urination. Its length and location are different in males and females.</p><p>The urinary system, also known as the renal system, plays a vital role in keeping our bodies in balance. Beyond just producing urine, it performs several critical tasks that are essential for overall health.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="urine2">Key Functions</h3>
<br>
<p><b>Filtration and Waste Removal:</b> The kidneys are the powerhouse of the system. They filter about 180 liters of blood every day, removing waste products like <b>urea</b> and <b>uric acid</b>. These are byproducts of protein breakdown and are toxic if they build up in the body. This process helps to detoxify the blood and maintain a clean internal environment.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Blood Pressure Regulation:</b> The kidneys are directly involved in controlling blood pressure. They produce the hormone <b>renin</b>, which helps regulate blood vessel constriction. They also manage the body's fluid balance, which directly impacts blood volume and, consequently, blood pressure.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Electrolyte Balance:</b> The urinary system carefully manages the levels of important electrolytes such as <b>sodium</b>, <b>potassium</b>, and <b>calcium</b>. Maintaining the correct balance of these minerals is crucial for proper nerve signaling, muscle function, and heart rhythm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Hormone Production:</b> The kidneys produce hormones that have wide-ranging effects. One of these is <b>erythropoietin</b>, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Another key hormone is one that helps convert vitamin D into its active form, which is necessary for the absorption of calcium and the development of strong bones.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="urine3">Common Issues</h3>
<br>
<p><b>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</b> These are very common and are caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract. They can affect the urethra or bladder, causing symptoms like a burning sensation during urination and frequent urges to go.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Kidney Stones:</b> These are hard, crystal-like masses that form inside the kidneys. They can cause intense pain when they move and may block the flow of urine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):</b> This is a long-term condition where the kidneys slowly lose their function. It's often caused by other diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure, and in severe cases, it can lead to kidney failure.</p>

 <h2 id="neuron"> The Nervous System</h2>
​<p> <img src="neuron.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">
<br> 
The nervous system is the body's control center, coordinating all voluntary and involuntary actions. It's an intricate network of nerves and cells that transmit signals between different parts of the body.
</p>
​<h3>Central Nervous System (CNS)</h3>
<p>
The CNS is the main processing center. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord.
<br>
<b>Brain:</b> The command center for the entire body. It controls thoughts, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, and temperature.
<br>
<b>Spinal Cord:</b> A long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that extends from the brain. It's the primary highway for messages between the brain and the rest of the body.
</p>
<h3 id="neuron1"> Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</h3>
<p>
The PNS is the network of nerves outside the CNS. It connects the CNS to the limbs and organs.
<br>
<b>Somatic Nervous System:</b> This part controls voluntary movements. It includes nerves that connect to muscles and sensory receptors.
<br>
<b>Autonomic Nervous System:</b> This part regulates involuntary functions like heartbeat, digestion, and breathing. It's further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
</p>
<p>
<br>
The Nervous System is an incredibly complex and fascinating subject! I'm glad you're interested in science.
</p><p>
The nervous system is the body's ultimate communication network, built of specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals. It's so much more than just the brain and spinal cord; it's a vast, interconnected system that orchestrates everything from blinking to running.
</p>
<h3 id="neuron2"> Neurons: The Building Blocks</h3>
<p>
The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the <b>neuron</b>, or nerve cell. Neurons are unique because they can transmit signals over long distances. A typical neuron has three main parts:
<br>
<b>Dendrites:</b> These are the "antennae" of the neuron, receiving signals from other cells.
<br>
<b>Cell Body (Soma):</b> This is the neuron's "control center" where signals are processed.
<br>
<b>Axon:</b> This is the long, slender projection that transmits the signal to other neurons, muscles, or glands.
<br>
<b>Myelin Sheath:</b> A fatty layer that insulates the axon, allowing for faster and more efficient signal transmission. Think of it like the plastic coating on an electrical wire.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Neurons communicate at a gap called a <b>synapse</b>. When an electrical signal reaches the end of an axon, it triggers the release of chemical messengers called <b>neurotransmitters</b>. These neurotransmitters cross the synapse and bind to receptors on the next neuron, continuing the signal.
</p>
​<h3>Divisions of the Nervous System</h3>
<p>
The nervous system is split into two major parts, which work together seamlessly.
</p>
<br>
<b>Central Nervous System (CNS)</b>
<br>
<p>
This is the command center, where information is integrated and decisions are made. It's protected by bone: the brain is in the skull and the spinal cord is in the vertebral column.
<br>
The <b>brain</b> is divided into three main regions: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The <b>cerebrum</b>, part of the forebrain, is responsible for higher-level functions like thought and language. The <b>cerebellum</b>, in the hindbrain, coordinates movement and balance.
<br>
The <b>spinal cord</b> acts as a two-way street, sending motor commands from the brain to the body and relaying sensory information from the body back to the brain. It also handles reflexes, allowing for quick, automatic responses without involving the brain.
</p>
<br>
<b>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</b>
<br>
<p>
This is the extensive network of nerves that extends from the CNS to every part of the body. It acts as the messenger, carrying information to and from the CNS.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The PNS has two subdivisions:
<br>
<b>Somatic Nervous System:</b> This system controls voluntary movements and processes external stimuli. It's what allows you to walk, talk, and feel a touch.
<br>
<b>Autonomic Nervous System:</b> This system regulates involuntary body functions. You don't have to consciously think about your heart beating or your stomach digesting food—the autonomic system handles it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The autonomic system itself has two branches that work in opposition:
<br>
<b>Sympathetic Nervous System:</b> This is the "fight-or-flight" response. It prepares the body for action by increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and slowing digestion.
<br>
<b>Parasympathetic Nervous System:</b> This is the "rest-and-digest" response. It calms the body down after danger has passed, lowering heart rate and promoting digestion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The entire nervous system, with its complex network of neurons and its different divisions, is a testament to the incredible intricacy of biological science.

<h2 id="mu"> The Musculoskeletal System</h2>
  <img src="mu.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

​<p>The musculoskeletal system is an intricate biological system that provides form, stability, and movement to the human body. It is composed of two primary components: the muscular system and the skeletal system.</p>
​<p>The skeletal system is the body's framework. It includes all the bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Bones provide the structure and protection for internal organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, and the ribs protect the heart and lungs. Ligaments are fibrous tissues that connect bones to other bones, while tendons are strong cords that attach muscles to bones. The skeleton also plays a vital role in blood cell production and mineral storage, particularly calcium.</p>
​<br>
<h3> The Muscular System</h3>
​<p>The muscular system is responsible for movement. It consists of various types of muscles, but the most well-known are the skeletal muscles. These are voluntary muscles, meaning you can consciously control their movement. They work in pairs, with one muscle contracting while the other relaxes, to pull on bones and create motion.</p>
​<p>For example, to bend your elbow, the biceps muscle contracts and shortens, while the triceps muscle on the back of your arm relaxes. To straighten your arm, the opposite happens: the biceps relax, and the triceps muscle contracts.</p>
​<br>
​<p>The musculoskeletal system is an amazing example of how different parts of the body work together. Without the strong framework of the skeleton and the pulling power of the muscles, we wouldn't be able to move, stand, or perform any physical tasks. It's a testament to the complexity and efficiency of human biology.</p>​<p>The musculoskeletal system is a complex network of tissues and organs that provides the body with the ability to move, stand, and maintain its form. It is a true marvel of biomechanics and physiology, allowing for everything from the most delicate hand movements to the powerful strides of a sprinter.</p>
​<h3 id="mu1" >The Skeletal System: More Than Just a Framework</h3>
​<p>The skeletal system is the body's internal support structure, comprised of over 200 bones in an adult. Beyond its role as a scaffold, it is a dynamic, living tissue with several critical functions. </p><p>The skeleton is divided into two main parts: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton includes the bones of the skull, vertebral column (spine), and the thoracic cage (ribs and sternum). Its primary function is to protect the major internal organs. The appendicular skeleton consists of the limbs and the girdles that attach them to the axial skeleton, such as the pectoral (shoulder) and pelvic girdles. Its purpose is to facilitate movement.</p>
​<p>The ends of bones are covered in cartilage, a smooth, elastic tissue that prevents bones from grinding against each other. Joints, the places where two or more bones meet, are held together by ligaments, which are strong, fibrous bands of connective tissue. This intricate design allows for a wide range of motion while maintaining stability. Bones also serve as a crucial reservoir for minerals like calcium and phosphorus and are the site of hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation that occurs in the bone marrow.</p>
​<br>
​<br>
<h3 id="mu2">The Muscular System: The Engine of Movement</h3>
​<p>The muscular system is what gives the body its power and ability to move. It is composed of three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. While all are essential, skeletal muscles are the ones directly involved in moving the skeleton. </p><p>Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons, which are tough bands of fibrous tissue. These muscles are described as voluntary, meaning their contraction is under conscious control. They are organized into bundles called fascicles, which are in turn made up of individual muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber contains tiny contractile units called  <b>sarcomer</b>which are composed of two proteins: actin and myosin. The interaction between these two proteins, a process known as the sliding filament theory, is what causes a muscle to contract and shorten, pulling on the bone to which it is attached.</p>
​<br>
​<br>
​<h3>How the Systems Work Together</h3>
​<p>The synergistic relationship between the skeletal and muscular systems is what makes movement possible. Muscles can only pull; they cannot push. Therefore, they often work in opposing pairs, known as antagonistic pairs. For example, the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii are an antagonistic pair in the upper arm. To flex the elbow, the biceps contracts while the triceps relaxes. To extend the elbow, the triceps contracts while the biceps relaxes.</p>
​<p>This coordinated effort, along with the support of ligaments and cartilage, allows for a vast array of movements, from walking and running to writing and playing a musical instrument. The integrity and health of both systems are vital for maintaining physical function and a good quality of life.</p>

<br>



<h2 id="tem">The Endocrine System</h2>
  <img src="end.jpg" height="250pc" width="350px">

​<p>The endocrine system is a collection of glands that produce hormones, which are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to regulate a wide range of bodily functions. Think of it as the body's wireless communication network, sending signals that control growth, metabolism, reproduction, and mood. The term "endocrine" comes from the Greek words endon meaning "within" and krinein meaning "to secrete," perfectly describing how these glands secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.</p>
​<p>Key glands in this system include the pituitary gland, often called the "master gland" because it controls many other endocrine glands; the thyroid gland, which regulates metabolism and energy; the pancreas, which manages blood sugar levels with insulin and glucagon; and the adrenal glands, which produce hormones like adrenaline to manage stress responses. The hypothalamus in the brain acts as the control center, linking the nervous system to the endocrine system. The effects of the endocrine system are often slower and longer-lasting than those of the nervous system. Hormones bind to specific receptors on target cells, triggering a response. </p>

<h2 id="tem1"> The integumentary System</h2> <img src="int.jpg" height="350px" width="350x">

​<p>The integumentary system is the body's largest organ system, and it is a fascinating subject for a science lover. It's essentially our body's protective outer layer, comprising the skin, hair, nails, and various glands like sweat and oil glands. The name "integumentary" comes from the Latin word integumentum, meaning "a covering." The skin is a highly complex organ that does far more than just cover us; it acts as a critical barrier between our internal environment and the outside world.</p>
​<p>The skin is made up of three primary layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis (or subcutaneous layer). The epidermis is the outermost layer, and it is primarily responsible for protection. It is a waterproof layer that renews itself constantly, shedding old cells and producing new ones. It also contains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives our skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin provides some protection from harmful UV radiation from the sun. </p><br>
<br>
​<h3 id="tem2">The Dermis and Beyond</h3>
​<p>Beneath the epidermis lies the dermis, a thicker layer that contains connective tissue, hair follicles, sweat glands, blood vessels, and nerve endings. The sweat glands help regulate body temperature through perspiration. 
Nerve endings within the dermis are what allow us to feel touch, temperature, and pain, giving the integumentary system a crucial sensory role. Hair follicles are also located here, and each hair is made of a protein called keratin. Nails, which are found on the tips of our fingers and toes, are also made of this strong protein.</p>
​<p>The deepest layer is the hypodermis, which is composed of adipose tissue (fat). This layer serves as a cushion, a shock absorber, and an insulator to help regulate body temperature. It also connects the skin to the underlying muscles and bones. Together, these layers of the integumentary system protect against infection, regulate temperature, dispose of waste products, and provide sensory information, making it one of the most vital systems for our survival

    <h2 id="class">Classification of Living Things</h2><br> <img src="class.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

<p>The classification of living things is a core part of the science of biology. It's also known as taxonomy, and it's the practice of grouping organisms together based on their shared characteristics. This helps scientists to organize and understand the immense diversity of life on Earth. The main goal is to create a universal system that reflects the evolutionary relationships between different organisms.</p>
<br>
<p>The most widely used system today is the Linnaean taxonomy, developed by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century. His system uses a hierarchical structure, moving from very broad categories to much more specific ones. This structure is a fundamental concept in biological studies.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Ranks of Classification</h3>
<br>
<p>The Linnaean system uses a series of ranks, each one more specific than the last. Let's break down the main ranks, starting from the broadest:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Domain</b>: This is the highest rank. There are three domains that encompass all life on Earth: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Eukarya includes all organisms with a nucleus, such as plants, animals, fungi, and protists.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Kingdom</b>: The next level down. Traditionally, living things were sorted into five kingdoms: Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. However, modern science has revised this, often using a six-kingdom model or more complex structures based on genetic evidence. The most common of these include Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Phylum</b>: A significant division within a kingdom. For instance, within the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata includes all animals with a backbone, while the phylum Arthropoda includes insects, spiders, and crustaceans.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Class</b>: A group of related orders. The phylum Chordata includes classes such as Mammalia (mammals), Reptilia (reptiles), and Aves (birds).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Order</b>: A group of related families. The class Mammalia includes orders like Primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) and Cetacea (whales and dolphins).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Family</b>: A group of related genera. The order Primates includes the family Hominidae (great apes and humans) and Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Genus</b>: A group of very closely related species. The family Hominidae contains the genus Homo (humans) and the genus Pan (chimpanzees).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Species</b>: This is the most specific rank. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Our species is Homo sapiens. This is the fundamental unit of classification.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="class1">Binomial Nomenclature</h3>
<br>
<p>Linnaeus also developed the system of binomial nomenclature, which gives every organism a unique two-part scientific name. The name is composed of the genus and the species, and it is always written in italics. The genus name is capitalized, while the species name is lowercase. For example, the scientific name for a domestic dog is Canis lupus. This system provides a universal and unambiguous way to refer to any specific organism, avoiding the confusion of common names that vary by language and region.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="class2">Why is Classification Important?</h3>
<br>

<p>Classification is not just about organizing information; it provides valuable insights into evolution and biological relationships. It helps scientists to:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Provide a universal language for biologists worldwide.</li>
<li>Understand evolutionary relationships by showing how different groups of organisms are related to each other.</li>
<li>Predict the characteristics of newly discovered organisms based on their classification.</li>
<li>Help manage and conserve biodiversity by providing a framework for studying and protecting different species.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The field of taxonomy is constantly evolving with new discoveries and advancements in genetic sequencing. This ongoing process refines our understanding of the vast and intricate tree of life on our planet.</p>
<br><h3>The Deeper Science</h3>
<p>The classification of living things, or taxonomy, is a vast and ever-evolving field of science. It is the practice and science of categorizing all organisms. The goal is not simply to create a list, but to build a system that reflects the evolutionary relationships and common ancestry between different forms of life. This is an exciting part of science because it's constantly being updated with new discoveries, particularly from genetics.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Linnaean Hierarchy in Greater Detail</h3>
<p>The system proposed by Carolus Linnaeus is the bedrock of modern taxonomy. His hierarchical structure is a set of nested categories, where each level gets more specific than the one above it. Let’s examine each of these ranks more closely, using the example of a familiar animal, the gray wolf (Canis lupus).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Domain</b>: The highest rank, a very broad category. All life is divided into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The gray wolf is in the Eukarya domain because its cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
</p><br>
<p><b>Kingdom</b>: The next level. Eukarya is split into four main kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista. The gray wolf is in the Animalia kingdom, as it is a multicellular, heterotrophic organism that consumes other organisms for energy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Phylum</b>: A major division within a kingdom. The kingdom Animalia has many phyla, including Chordata. The gray wolf is in the phylum Chordata, which includes all vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Class</b>: The phylum Chordata is divided into classes like Mammalia, Aves (birds), and Reptilia (reptiles). The gray wolf is in the class Mammalia because it is warm-blooded, has hair, and produces milk to feed its young.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Order</b>: This groups related families. The class Mammalia includes orders like Primates (monkeys, humans) and Rodentia (rodents). The gray wolf belongs to the order Carnivora, which includes all meat-eating mammals.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Family</b>: The order Carnivora includes families such as Felidae (cats) and Canidae (dogs, wolves, foxes). The gray wolf is in the family Canidae, a group of animals that are all descendants of a common ancestor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Genus</b>: This is a group of very closely related species. The family Canidae includes the genus Canis, which contains wolves, dogs, coyotes, and jackals. These animals are so closely related that they share very recent common ancestry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Species</b>: The most specific rank. Organisms of the same species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. The gray wolf's species is lupus. The full scientific name is Canis lupus.</p>
<br>
<h3>Beyond Linnaeus: The Rise of Modern Phylogenetics</h3>
<p>While the Linnaean system is still used today, modern science has moved beyond it in some ways. The field of phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms. Instead of just grouping by physical traits, scientists now use DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and molecular data to build evolutionary trees, also known as cladograms. These trees show the exact lineage and common ancestors of different species. This has led to major revisions in the tree of life, as some organisms that looked similar were found to be genetically very different, and vice-versa.</p>
<br>
<p>A key concept in phylogenetics is the clade, which is a group of organisms that includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants. For example, the great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans) and humans form a clade because they all share a common ancestor. This modern approach is more accurate and provides a truer picture of life’s history on Earth.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="class3">The Importance of a Robust Classification System</h3>
<p>Classification is much more than a simple organizational tool. It's essential for several reasons:</p>
<br>
<p><b>1. Universal Communication</b>: A scientific name like Panthera leo for a lion is understood by scientists everywhere, regardless of their native language. This prevents confusion with common names that can be different in various parts of the world.</p>
<br>
<p><b>2. Understanding Evolution</b>: By seeing which organisms are grouped together, we can infer their evolutionary relationships. This helps us trace the history of life and understand how different traits evolved over millions of years.</p>
<br>
<p><b>3. Conservation and Biodiversity</b>: A clear classification system helps us identify and catalog the planet's vast biodiversity. This is crucial for protecting endangered species and understanding ecosystems. Knowing a species' family and genus can give clues about its biology, which can inform conservation efforts.</p>
<br>
<p><b>4. Medical and Agricultural Applications</b>: Classifying organisms helps us identify pathogens and pests, which is critical for developing treatments and protecting food supplies. Knowing that two disease-causing bacteria belong to the same genus can help predict how they might behave or what treatments might be effective.</p>
<br>
<p>In summary, the classification of living things is a powerful and essential tool that reveals the interconnectedness of all life on our planet. It is a fundamental part of the scientific discipline of biology. </p>

    <h2 id="gen">Genetics</h2>
    
    <p><img src="gen.jpg" height="350px" width="280px">

Genetics and heredity are fundamental concepts in biology that explain how traits are passed from parents to offspring. <b>Genetics</b> is the scientific study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity. <b>Heredity</b>, on the other hand, is the process by which a parent passes certain genes to their children.
</p>
<br>
​The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
​<p>
The flow of genetic information in a cell is described by the <b>Central Dogma of Molecular Biology</b>. It explains how DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is then translated into protein.
<br>
<b>DNA</b> (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic blueprint of an organism. It's a double-stranded helix that contains the instructions for making all the proteins in a cell. <b>Genes</b> are specific segments of DNA that contain these instructions.
<br>
<b>Transcription</b> is the process where a gene's DNA sequence is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This happens in the nucleus of a cell. The mRNA then travels out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
<br>
<b>Translation</b> is the process where the mRNA sequence is used to create a protein. This occurs at the <b>ribosomes</b>. The sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is read in groups of three, called <b>codons</b>, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. These amino acids are then linked together to form a protein.
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="gen1">key Concepts in Heredity
</h3>
​<p>
<b>Alleles</b> are different versions of the same gene. For example, a gene for eye color might have an allele for blue eyes and another for brown eyes.
<br>
An organism's <b>genotype</b> is its complete set of genes, while its <b>phenotype</b> is the observable traits resulting from those genes. For instance, the genotype might be the alleles for brown and blue eyes, but the phenotype is the actual brown eye color.
<br>
<b>Dominant</b> alleles are expressed even if only one copy is present, while <b>recessive</b> alleles are only expressed if two copies are present. In the eye color example, the allele for brown eyes is typically dominant over the allele for blue eyes.
<br>
A person with two identical alleles for a gene is <b>homozygous</b>, while a person with two different alleles is <b>heterozygous</b>. A person with one dominant and one recessive allele for eye color is heterozygous but will have the brown-eyed phenotype.
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="gen2">
   The Work of Gregor Mendel</h3>
​<p>
The field of genetics was pioneered by <b>Gregor Mendel</b>, an Austrian monk who conducted experiments with pea plants in the mid-19th century. His work laid the foundation for modern genetics. He developed two key laws:
<br>
The <b>Law of Segregation</b> states that during the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells), the two alleles for a trait separate so that each gamete only carries one allele.
<br>
The <b>Law of Independent Assortment</b> states that the alleles of two or more different genes are sorted into gametes independently of one another. This means that the inheritance of one trait does not influence the inheritance of another.
</p>
<br>
​Beyond Mendel: Modern Genetics
​<p>
While Mendel's laws are fundamental, not all inheritance patterns follow them perfectly. <b>Incomplete dominance</b> occurs when a heterozygous individual shows a phenotype that is a blend of the two alleles. For example, a red flower and a white flower might produce pink offspring.
<br>
<b>Codominance</b> is when both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype. A great example is human blood type, where both A and B alleles can be expressed at the same time, resulting in AB blood type.
<br>
<b>Polygenic inheritance</b> involves traits controlled by multiple genes, such as height and skin color. This results in a wide range of phenotypes, not just a few distinct categories.
<br>
Understanding these concepts helps us explain everything from why we have our parents' eye color to why we're susceptible to certain diseases. It's a vast and fascinating field.
</p><br>
<h2>An In-Depth Look </h2>
<p>Genetics and heredity are the cornerstone of modern biology. Genetics is the scientific study of genes, heredity, and the variation of inherited characteristics in living organisms. Heredity is the process by which traits are passed from parents to their offspring. Together, they explain why offspring resemble their parents but are not identical to them. The entire field is built on the incredible discovery of the gene, the fundamental unit of heredity.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="gen3">The Blueprint of Life: DNA, Genes, and Chromosomes</h3>
<img src="gen1.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">
<p>At the heart of genetics is Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. DNA is a complex molecule that looks like a twisted ladder, known as the double helix. It contains all the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive, and reproduce. A gene is a specific segment of this DNA that codes for a particular trait or protein. Genes are located on structures called chromosomes, which are long strands of DNA tightly coiled with proteins. Humans typically have 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs within each of their cells.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Father of Modern Genetics: Gregor Mendel</h3>
<p>Our understanding of heredity began with the work of an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel in the 19th century. Through his meticulous experiments with pea plants, he established the basic principles of inheritance. He observed that traits like flower color or plant height were not blended in offspring but were inherited as discrete units, which we now call genes. Mendel formulated two key laws:</p>
<br>
<p><b>1. The Law of Segregation</b>: This law states that an organism inherits one allele for each gene from each parent. During the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells), these two alleles separate, so each gamete only carries one allele.</p>
<br>
<p><b>2. The Law of Independent Assortment</b>: This law states that the inheritance of one gene is independent of the inheritance of another. For example, the gene for pea color is passed on independently of the gene for pea shape, as long as they are on separate chromosomes.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="gen4">Key Terminology in Heredity</h3>
<p>To understand how traits are passed on, it is essential to know these terms:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Allele</b>: An allele is a specific version of a gene. For example, for the gene for flower color in pea plants, there can be a purple allele and a white allele.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Genotype</b>: The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism. It refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a given trait.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Phenotype</b>: The phenotype is the physical, observable trait that is expressed. It is the result of the genotype and environmental factors.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Dominant and Recessive Alleles</b>: A dominant allele will always be expressed in the phenotype, even if only one copy is present. A recessive allele is only expressed when two copies of it are present (one from each parent).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Homozygous and Heterozygous</b>: An organism is homozygous for a gene if it has two identical alleles (e.g., two dominant or two recessive). It is heterozygous if it has two different alleles (one dominant and one recessive).</p>
<br>
<h3>How Traits are Inherited: Punnett Squares and Meiosis</h3>
<p>A Punnett square is a simple diagram used to predict the possible genotypes of offspring from a genetic cross. It's a visual tool that demonstrates the principles of segregation and independent assortment. For example, crossing two heterozygous parents (both having one dominant and one recessive allele) for a trait would result in offspring with a predictable ratio of genotypes and phenotypes.</p>
<br>
<p>The biological process behind this is meiosis, the type of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and egg cells). During meiosis, the pairs of chromosomes are separated and randomly distributed to the gametes. This ensures that each gamete has only one set of chromosomes, allowing for the correct number of chromosomes to be restored when a sperm fertilizes an egg.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="gen5">Beyond Mendel: Complex Inheritance Patterns</h3>
<p>While Mendel's work provides a fundamental framework, not all traits follow a simple dominant/recessive pattern. Other inheritance patterns include:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Incomplete Dominance</b>: This occurs when one allele is not completely dominant over the other, leading to a blended or intermediate phenotype. For example, a red flower crossed with a white flower might produce pink offspring.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Codominance</b>: This is when both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype. A classic example is human blood type, where a person with both A and B alleles has a blood type of AB, with both traits being visible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Polygenic Inheritance</b>: Many traits, such as human height and skin color, are controlled by multiple genes. This results in a wide range of phenotypes, not just a few distinct categories.</p>
<br>
<p>Genetics continues to be a frontier of science, with ongoing research into gene expression, genetic engineering, and personalized medicine. The study of how our DNA shapes who we are is perhaps one of the most profound and fascinating areas of biology.</p>

    <h2 id="ecol">
      Ecology and Interdependence
    </h2>
​<p>
<b>Ecology</b> is the scientific study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment. It explores how organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whales, are affected by and adapt to their surroundings. It's a vast field that covers everything from a single bacterium's role in the soil to the complex dynamics of a global rainforest.
</p>
​<br>
​<p>
Within ecology, one of the most fundamental concepts is <b>interdependence</b>.  This refers to the mutual reliance of organisms on one another and on their physical environment for survival. No species exists in isolation. Every organism is part of a complex web of relationships that includes predator-prey dynamics, symbiotic relationships, and the cycling of nutrients.
</p><br>
​<h3 id="ecol1"> Predator-Prey Relationships</h3>
​<p>
Predator-prey relationships are a classic example of interdependence. <b>Predators</b>, like a lion, rely on their prey, like a zebra, for food. At the same time, the population of the prey species can influence the population of the predator. For example, if the zebra population declines due to disease, the lion population may also decline due to a lack of food. This constant fluctuation helps maintain a natural balance in the ecosystem.
</p>
​<br>
​<h3>Symbiotic Relationships</h3>
​<p>
Symbiosis describes a close and long-term interaction between two different biological species. There are several types:
<p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Mutualism</b>: Both species benefit from the relationship. A well-known example is the relationship between bees and flowers. The bees get nectar for food, and the flowers are pollinated, allowing them to reproduce.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Commensalism</b>: One species benefits, while the other is neither helped nor harmed. An example is a barnacle living on a whale. The barnacle gets a ride and a new habitat, while the whale is unaffected.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Parasitism</b>: One species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host). Ticks on a dog are a good example. The tick gets a blood meal, and the dog can suffer from irritation or disease.
</p>
<br>
​<br>
<p>
All of these intricate connections highlight the fragile and interconnected nature of life on Earth. A change in one part of an ecosystem, such as the removal of a key species, can have a domino effect throughout the entire system, leading to unexpected and sometimes devastating consequences.
</p>​<br>
​<h3 id="ecol2"> Food Chains and Trophic Levels</h3>
​<p>
One of the most straightforward ways to visualize interdependence is through a <b>food chain</b>. It's a linear sequence showing the flow of energy from one organism to another. For example, a grass plant is eaten by a rabbit, which is then eaten by a fox. However, nature is rarely so simple. A <b>food web</b> is a more accurate representation, showing the multiple, interconnected food chains within an ecosystem.
</p>
​<br>
​<p>
Within these food webs, organisms occupy different <b>trophic levels</b>.
</p>
​<br>
​<p>
<b>Producers</b> are the foundation. These are organisms, like plants and algae, that produce their own food using energy from the sun through photosynthesis.
</p>
​<br>
​<p>
<b>Consumers</b> are organisms that eat other organisms to get energy. These are further categorized: <b>primary consumers</b> (herbivores) eat producers; <b>secondary consumers</b> (carnivores or omnivores) eat primary consumers; and <b>tertiary consumers</b> eat secondary consumers.
</p>
​<br>
​<h3 id="ecol3">The Critical Role of Decomposers</h3>
​<p>
Often overlooked, <b>decomposers</b>, such as bacteria and fungi, are essential to interdependence. They break down dead organic matter and waste products, returning vital nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus back into the soil. Without decomposers, the nutrients would be locked away in dead organisms, and the ecosystem would eventually run out of the building blocks for life.
</p>
​<br>
​<h3>Keystone Species</h3>
​<p>
Some species have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their abundance. These are called <b>keystone species</b>. The removal of a keystone species can cause a dramatic shift or even the collapse of an entire ecosystem. For instance, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park helped to control the elk population, which in turn allowed for the regrowth of trees and the return of beavers and other animals.
</p>
​<br>
​<h3>Human Impact on Interdependence</h3>
​<p>
Human activities have a significant impact on these intricate relationships. <b>Habitat destruction</b>, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species can sever vital connections, leading to a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. For example, deforestation not only removes a habitat but also disrupts the delicate balance of a food web, affecting all the species that relied on that forest for food and shelter. Understanding interdependence is crucial to conserving our planet's biodiversity and ensuring the long-term health of our ecosystems.
